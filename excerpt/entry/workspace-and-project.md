> Workspaces in Mudirr act as a hub for your teams and projects. They are designed for long-term collaboration, where different projects can exist under one workspace. Think of workspaces as your company or department, while projects are the individual tasks or initiatives your team is working on. Projects typically have deadlines and specific outcomes, while workspaces are more ongoing and flexible. [mudirr.com, "Whatâ€™s the difference between a workspace and a project?"]
