> Software gives you influence over computers. Computers are cheap, fast, deterministic, and omnipresent. You can wrangle software into doing things faster than you can, halfway across the world, with complete control. But the reach of power that computers have in the world is extremely limited. Building with software lets you build personal tools, automated business systems, and so forth. But software doesn’t let you move people, and moving people is the most effective way to get things done in the real world.  
> For that, I think writing is the closest thing we have. Writing well lets you move people and ideas, and it’s the most scalable such medium. Just as a well-written piece of software can run on hundreds of thousands of machines, amplifying your productivity; a well-crafted piece of writing can move hundreds of thousands of people into collective action or care. It can amplify your own ideas and motivations by thousands of times, but instead of acting through cold deterministic metal agents of electricity, you’re now acting in concert with other people, who can build on your ideas and make real, significant events happen.

> 软件让你能够影响计算机。计算机便宜、快速、确定性强且无处不在。你可以操控软件做你在全球任何地方都能做的事情，而且能够完全掌控。但计算机在世界上拥有的权力范围却是极其有限的。用软件构建让你能打造个人工具、自动化业务系统等等。但是，软件并不能让你驱动人，而驱动人是让事情在现实中得以完成的最有效方式。  
> 为此，我认为写作是我们拥有的最接近的工具。写作得体能让你推动人和思想，它是最可扩展的媒介。正如一段编写良好的软件可以在成千上万的机器上运行，放大你的生产力；一篇精心创作的写作作品可以推动成千上万的人采取集体行动或关心某事。它可以将你的想法和动机放大数千倍，但你现在不是通过冷冰冰的决定性电金属代理来行动，而是与其他人协同作用，他们可以在你的想法基础上发展，促使真正显著的事件发生。 [linus.coffee, “Writing is software for human behavior”]
