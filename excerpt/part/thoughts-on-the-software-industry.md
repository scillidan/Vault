> If you look one way, mathematics is just a box of tools. Abstractions you can pull out to solve specific problems when we are faced with them. The field of mathematics grows by mining the space of yet-unknown facts to accumulate more and more powerful tools in this toolbox. But if you look another way, mathematics gives its practitioners access to a particular kind of worldview. It has its own vocabulary, its own taste of beauty and elegance. A world examined through the lens of combinatorics or statistics or graph theory yields qualitatively different understandings of the world. None are better or worse. Just defined from different abstractions.  
> I think software is very similar. Look one way, and it’s a set of tools for solving problems using computers, which are these interesting arrangements of wires we taught to mimic this ideal model of information processing. But eventually, if you take the deep dive I guess, software gives you its own set of abstractions and basic vocabulary with which to understand every experience. It sort of smells like mathematics in some ways. But software’s way of looking at the world is more about abstractions modeling underlying complexities in systems; signal vs. noise; scale and orders of magnitude; and information — how much there is, what we can do it with, how we can learn from it and model it. Software’s interpretation of reality is particularly important because software drives the world now, and the people who write the software that runs it see the world through this kind of “software’s worldview” — scaling laws, information theory, abstractions and complexity. I think over time I’ve come to believe that understanding this worldview is more interesting than learning to wield programming tools. [linus.coffee, "Thoughts on the software industry"]

> 从一个角度看，数学只是一箱工具。是一些抽象概念，你可以提取出来以解决特定问题。当我们面临问题时，这些工具会派上用场。数学领域通过挖掘尚未了解的事实来发展，以积累越来越强大的工具。但从另一个角度看，数学为其实践者提供了一种特定的世界观。它有自己的词汇，有自己的美感和优雅感。通过组合学、统计学或图论的视角来观察世界，会产生定性不同的理解。没有哪一种是更好或更差的。只是从不同的抽象定义而已。  
> 我认为软件非常类似。从一个角度看，它是一套用于解决计算机问题的工具，而这些计算机则是我们教会它们模仿理想信息处理模型的有趣电线排列。但最终，如果你深入探讨，我想软件会给你提供一套自己的抽象和基本词汇，以理解每一种体验。在某种程度上，它有点像数学。但软件的世界观更关注于对系统中潜在复杂性的建模；信号与噪声；规模和数量级；以及信息——有多少，我们能用它做什么，如何从中学习并进行建模。软件对现实的解释尤为重要，因为软件现在推动着世界，而编写运行这些软件的人正是通过这种“软件的世界观”来看待世界——缩放法则、信息理论、抽象和复杂性。随着时间的推移，我渐渐相信，理解这种世界观比学习如何使用编程工具更有趣。[linus.coffee, "Thoughts on the software industry"]
