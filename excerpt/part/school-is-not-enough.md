> The goal of education is to create a path to mastery or responsibility. If a child can sell the fruit of his labor, so much the better. But the essential lesson is that every difficult thing attempted acts as a multiplier on his confidence and the rest of his knowledge. Drudgery is sometimes confused with building character, and I think this is a mistake. It is building skill itself that builds self-possession. After selling thousands of dollars worth of pastries over the summer, a child does not only know that he can make pastries. He knows that he can make anything.  
> I think it is worth some special reflection as to why programming is now the typical industry for precocious children. In many ways, it has a low bar to entry and is something that parents still allow their children to “work at” do despite the hour-demands of systematized schooling. It is one of the few industries with an immensely permissionless culture. You don’t need an audience or patrons. You don’t have to ask anyone. You don’t have to get a building permit or any professional resources. You can just create. The advantages of this, especially for some children who are not allowed to do much else with their time, are immense. We should ask ourselves, slowly, carefully, and often: what else can be like that? [map.simonsarris.com, "School is Not Enough"]

> 教育的目标是创造一条通往掌握或责任的道路。如果一个孩子能出售自己劳动的果实，那就更好了。但根本的教训是，每一次尝试的困难都能作为他自信和其他知识的乘数。苦工有时与塑造品格相混淆，而我认为这是一个错误。培养技能本身就是塑造自我控制的过程。在夏天销售价值数千美元的糕点之后，一个孩子不仅知道他能做糕点。他知道他能做任何事情。  
> 我认为值得特别反思的是，为什么编程现在成为了早熟孩子的典型行业。在许多方面，它的准入门槛较低，父母仍然允许他们的孩子在繁重的系统化学习中“工作”。它也是少数拥有极其宽松文化的行业之一。你不需要观众或赞助人。你不必问任何人。你不需要建筑许可证或任何专业资源。你可以直接创造。对于一些被限制在其他活动中的孩子来说，这种优势是巨大的。我们应该慢慢、仔细且经常问自己：还有什么事情是这样的吗？ [map.simonsarris.com, "School is Not Enough"]
