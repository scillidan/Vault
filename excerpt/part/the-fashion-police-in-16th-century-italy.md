> On 15 September 1595, a Genoese man-about-town called Salvagio de Aste was spotted breaking the law. The record in Genoa’s state archives describes with remarkable precision what Salvagio was wearing that autumn day as he strolled through the square of San Siro. He must have cut a dashing figure. He sported “an embroidered cap, a silk doublet of many colours with gold buttons on the sleeves, two rings with white stones on his fingers, a jerkin and embroidered hose in black silk”.
>
> The detail with which Salvagio’s attire was noted is no accident: his showy and costly clothing was his crime. His colourful and lavishly embellished costume had fallen foul of Genoa’s Magistrato delle Pompe, whose role it was to enforce the sumptuary laws that regulated what men and women could wear. Patrolling the streets and squares of the bustling city as arbiters of the level of ostentation that was deemed appropriate, the sumptuary magistrates were quite simply the Fashion Police.

> The role of these magistrates, and their (largely unsuccessful) attempts to moderate excessive spending, is one strand of research into clothing in early modern Genoa by Giulia Galastro, a PhD candidate at Cambridge University. In particular, she is interested in the ways in which the materiality of fabric is interwoven with the fabric of society in Genoa – a centre of the Italian silk trade and a city famous for its production of sumptuous velvets and other luxurious textiles.

> 1595年9月15日，一位名叫萨尔瓦乔·阿斯特（Salvagio de Aste）的热那亚绅士被发现违法。热那亚国家档案馆的记录详细描述了Salvagio在秋日漫步圣西罗广场时的着装。他一定是个受注目之人。他身穿“一顶刺绣帽子，一件袖口镶有金钮扣的彩色丝绸紧身上衣，手指上戴着两枚白宝石戒指，一件马甲和黑色丝绸刺绣长袜”。
> 
> 对Salvagio的服装进行如此详细的记录并非偶然：他那华丽而昂贵的服饰正是他的罪行。他色彩斑斓、装饰华丽的服装违反了热那亚的虚荣法官的规定，他们的职责是执行规范男女着装的禁奢法案。他们巡逻在繁华城市的街头和广场，作为仲裁者去判断何为合适的炫耀程度，禁奢法官，简单来说就是时尚警察。

> 这些法官的角色，以及他们（基本上并不成功）试图限制过度消费的努力，是剑桥大学博士生朱利娅·加拉斯特罗（Giulia Galastro）对早期热那亚服装的研究的一个方面。她特别关注织物的材料如何与社会的结构交织在一起，在热那亚——意大利丝绸贸易中心，一座以生产奢华天鹅绒和其他豪华纺织品闻名的城市。
