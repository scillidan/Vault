> The first is your creative input. This is a measure of the diversity and volume of interesting stories, knowledge, music, ideas, and advice you hear regularly. More and more, interesting ideas come to me as a combination of something I read or learned before, and an interesting metaphor or perspective I hear in the moment. The more quality, creative content you consume, the more source material you have from which your brain can synthesize new creative ideas. The diversity of content matters here. You’re going to have much better luck producing creative ideas when you combine knowledge or stories about completely different, unrelated topics, than by combining related existing ideas with each other.

> 第一个是你的创意输入。这是一个衡量你定期听到的有趣故事、知识、音乐、想法和建议的多样性和数量的标准。越来越多时，有趣的想法是我从之前阅读或学习的内容以及当下听到的有趣隐喻或视角的结合而来。你消费的优质创意内容越多，你的大脑就越有材料可以合成新的创意想法。在这里，内容的多样性很重要。当你结合完全不同、无关的话题的知识或故事时，你产生创意想法的几率会更大，而不是将相关的现有想法彼此结合。 [linus.coffee, “How to get lots of ideas for side projects and writing”]
