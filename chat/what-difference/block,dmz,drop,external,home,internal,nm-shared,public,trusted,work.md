What is the difference between zone block,dmz,drop,external,home,internal,nm-shared,public,trusted,work in firewalld?

```md
In `firewalld`, zones are used to define the level of trust for network connections and to apply specific firewall rules according to the network environment. Each zone specifies a set of rules that can allow or deny traffic based on the source of that traffic. Below are the definitions of the different zones you mentioned:

1. **block**: This zone is used to block all incoming traffic, without allowing any outbound traffic by default. It’s a strict zone meant primarily for security.

2. **dmz**: The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is used for a network that is open to unrestricted access from the outside world but is not trusted. Typically, servers exposed to the internet (like web servers) may be placed in this zone. It allows limited incoming traffic while blocking most incoming traffic.

3. **drop**: This zone is more restrictive than block. It drops all incoming network packets without any response, effectively making systems in this zone invisible. Outgoing connections are allowed, but incoming requests are silently discarded.

4. **external**: This zone is designed for connections that are sourced from untrusted networks, usually the internet. It allows for masquerading (NAT) and is often used for external interfaces where you want to allow specific traffic while limiting incoming traffic.

5. **home**: The home zone is configured for a trusted home network. It allows most incoming connections by default, which is suitable for devices in a home environment that are relatively trusted.

6. **internal**: This zone represents an internal, trusted network. It has a more permissive policy than some of the other zones, allowing traffic between connected devices on the same network.

7. **nm-shared**: This zone is specifically designed for connections that are shared by the NetworkManager. It allows for connections that have been shared with other devices, typically for use in local area networks.

8. **public**: This zone is used for a public network where you may wish to allow limited incoming connections but still want to maintain a level of security. It is more restrictive than home or internal but less so than drop or block.

9. **trusted**: The trusted zone allows all incoming traffic and treats all connections as fully trusted. This zone is suitable for environments where you trust all systems on the network.

10. **work**: The work zone is intended for office or enterprise networks. It allows some incoming traffic for work-related services while maintaining a level of control over what is allowed.

In summary, these zones range from highly permissive (trusted, home, internal) to highly restrictive (drop, block, dmz), allowing you to tailor firewall rules according to the specific network environment and security preferences. Each zone is associated with a different level of trust and defines the behavior of firewall rules applied to the network interfaces assigned to that zone.

在 `firewalld` 中，区域用于定义网络连接的信任级别，并根据网络环境应用特定的防火墙规则。每个区域指定了一组规则，可以根据流量的来源来允许或拒绝流量。以下是您提到的不同区域的定义：

1. **block**：此区域用于阻止所有传入流量，默认情况下不允许任何出站流量。这是一个严格的区域，主要用于安全目的。

2. **dmz**：非军事区（DMZ）用于对外部世界开放但不受信任的网络。通常，暴露在互联网上的服务器（如Web服务器）可能会放置在此区域。它允许有限的传入流量，同时阻止大多数传入流量。

3. **drop**：此区域比 block 更具限制性。它会丢弃所有传入网络数据包而不作任何回应，从而有效地使该区域中的系统不可见。出站连接被允许，但传入请求被无声丢弃。

4. **external**：此区域旨在用于来自不受信任网络（通常是互联网）的连接。它允许地址伪装（NAT），通常用于外部接口，您希望允许特定流量的同时限制传入流量。

5. **home**：家用区域配置用于受信任的家庭网络。默认情况下，它允许大多数传入连接，这适合于家庭环境中相对受信任的设备。

6. **internal**：此区域代表一个内部受信任的网络。它的策略比其他区域更宽松，允许同一网络上已连接设备之间的流量。

7. **nm-shared**：此区域专门为由 NetworkManager 共享的连接而设计。它允许与其他设备共享的连接，通常用于局域网。

8. **public**：此区域用于公共网络，您可能希望允许有限的传入连接，但仍然希望保持一定程度的安全性。它比 home 或 internal 更具限制性，但又不如 drop 或 block 严格。

9. **trusted**：受信任区域允许所有传入流量，并将所有连接视为完全信任。此区域适合于您信任网络中所有系统的环境。

10. **work**：工作区用于办公室或企业网络。它允许一些与工作相关的服务的传入流量，同时保持对允许内容的控制。

总之，这些区域的范围从高度宽松（trusted、home、internal）到高度限制（drop、block、dmz），允许您根据特定的网络环境和安全偏好来调整防火墙规则。每个区域与不同的信任级别相关联，并定义应用于分配给该区域的网络接口的防火墙规则的行为。
