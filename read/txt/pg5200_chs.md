Metamorphosis



by Franz Kafka



Translated by David Wyllie





I


我


One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.

一天清晨，格里高尔·萨姆沙从噩梦中醒来，发现自己躺在床上，变成了一只可怕的害虫。他仰面朝天，如同盔甲般覆盖着身体，稍稍抬起头，就能看到略呈穹顶状的棕色腹部，被拱起的部分分成几块僵硬的腹肌。

The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.

被褥几乎遮不住他的身体，仿佛随时都会滑落。他的几条腿，与身体其他部分相比，瘦得可怜，无助地挥舞着，他望着前方。



“What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.

“我这是怎么了？”他心想。这不是梦。他的房间，一个真正的人类房间，虽然略显狭小，却静静地躺在四面熟悉的墙壁之间。桌上摊开着一堆纺织品样品——萨姆沙是个旅行推销员——样品上方挂着一幅他最近从一本插画杂志上剪下来的画，装在一个漂亮的镀金相框里。画中一位女士戴着皮帽，围着皮围巾，端坐着，将一个盖住她整条小臂的厚厚的皮套子朝着观众举起。



Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.

格里高尔转过身，望着窗外阴沉的天气。雨滴敲打在玻璃上的声音传来，让他感到一阵难过。

“How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense”, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn’t get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn’t have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before.

“要不我再睡一会儿，忘掉这些胡闹？”他想，但他做不到，因为他习惯了向右侧睡，而现在这种状态下，他根本没法摆出那个姿势。无论他怎么努力地向右侧翻滚，他总是会滚回原来的位置。他肯定试过上百次，闭上眼睛，不去看那条挣扎的腿，直到那里开始传来一阵从未有过的轻微隐痛，他才停了下来。



“Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that I’ve chosen!

“哦，上帝”，他想，“我选择的职业是多么艰苦啊！

Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there’s the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!” He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn’t know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.

日复一日地奔波。做这样的生意比在家自己做生意要费力得多，而且还要承受旅途的折磨，担心赶不上火车，食物糟糕又不规律，总是和不同的人打交道，以至于你永远无法认识任何人或与他们成为朋友。这一切都见鬼去吧！”他感到腹部微微发痒；他慢慢地仰面朝床头板坐起来，这样他就能更好地抬起头；找到了发痒的地方，发现那里布满了许多不知道是什么的小白点；当他试图用一条腿去摸那个地方时，他迅速地缩了回去，因为他一碰到它就浑身发冷。



He slid back into his former position. “Getting up early all the time”, he thought, “it makes you stupid. You’ve got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.

他又滑回了原来的位置。“总是早起，”他想，“会让你变傻。你得睡够。其他旅行推销员过着奢侈的生活。比如，每当我早上回到宾馆抄写合同时，这些先生们总是还坐在那里吃早餐。”

I ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out on the spot.

我应该跟我的老板试试这个办法；不然我会被当场踢出去。

But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn’t have my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice a long time ago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’d fall right off his desk! And it’s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money together to pay off my parents’ debt to him—another five or six years I suppose—that’s definitely what I’ll do. That’s when I’ll make the big change. First of all though, I’ve got to get up, my train leaves at five.”

但谁知道呢，也许那对我来说是最好的。如果不是要考虑父母，我早就辞职了，我会去找老板，告诉他我的想法，告诉他我想说的一切，让他知道我的感受。他会从桌子上摔下来的！坐在办公桌前，居高临下地跟下属说话，这感觉真滑稽，尤其是因为老板听力不好，你还得凑近。好吧，还是有希望的；等我攒够钱还清我父母欠他的债——我想还要五六年——我肯定会还的。到那时，我就会做出重大改变。不过首先，我得起床了，我的火车五点开。”



And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.

他看了一眼放在抽屉柜上的闹钟，闹钟滴答作响。

“God in Heaven!” he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss’s anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o’clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor’s not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss’s man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor’s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what’s more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.

“老天爷！”他心想。已经六点半了，指针却静静地向前移动，比六点半还晚，更像是七点四十五。闹钟没响吗？他躺在床上就能看到，闹钟定在了四点，这本该是四点；它肯定响了。是啊，可是，在家具发出嘎嘎作响的噪音中，他能安然入睡吗？没错，他睡得并不安稳，但或许正因为如此，他睡得更沉了。现在该怎么办？下一班火车七点开；如果要赶上，他就得拼命赶路，而样品的收集工作还没完成，他感觉一点也不精神，也不精神。就算他赶上了火车，也难逃老板的怒火，因为办公室助理会去送五点的火车开走，他早就把格里高尔不在的报告写上去了。办公室助理是老板的人，没骨气，又不懂事。如果他请病假怎么办？但这会非常牵强，也非常可疑，因为格里戈尔五年来从未生过病。他的老板肯定会带着医疗保险公司的医生过来，指责他父母生了一个懒惰的儿子，并接受医生的建议不报销病假，因为医生认为没有人真正生病过，只是很多人懒惰而已。而且，在这种情况下，他的判断真的完全错吗？事实上，除了睡了这么久之后感觉过度困倦之外，格里戈尔感觉完全没问题，甚至比平时饿得多。



He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a cautious knock at the door near his head. “Gregor”, somebody called—it was his mother—“it’s quarter to seven. Didn’t you want to go somewhere?” That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Gregor had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contented himself with saying: “Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I’m getting up now.” The change in Gregor’s voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor, against their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. “Gregor, Gregor”, he called, “what’s wrong?” And after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: “Gregor! Gregor!” At the other side door his sister came plaintively: “Gregor? Aren’t you well?

他正慌慌张张地想着这一切，迟迟没能下床，这时钟敲响了七点四十五。他头顶的门上传来一阵小心翼翼的敲门声。“格里高尔，”有人喊道——是他的母亲——“七点四十五了。你不是想去个地方吗？”多么温柔的声音！格里高尔听到自己的回答声时，吓了一跳，几乎听不出是刚才的声音。仿佛从他内心深处传来一阵痛苦而难以控制的吱吱声，起初还能听清，但随后又像回音一样，使声音变得模糊不清，让人不确定自己是否听清楚了。格里高尔本想完整地回答，解释一切，但在这种情况下，他只好勉强说道：“是的，妈妈，是的，谢谢你，我现在就起床。”格里高尔声音的变化或许隔着木门根本听不见，因为他的母亲对这个解释很满意，拖着脚步走了。但这段简短的对话让家里的其他成员意识到，格里高尔出乎意料地还在家里。不一会儿，他的父亲敲开了侧门，轻轻地，但用的是拳头。“格里高尔，格里高尔，”他喊道，“怎么了？”过了一会儿，他又用低沉的语气警告道：“格里高尔！格里高尔！”他的妹妹从另一扇侧门走来，哀怨地问道：“格里高尔？你不舒服吗？”

Do you need anything?” Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”, making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each, individual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: “Gregor, open the door, I beg of you.” Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home.

“你们需要什么吗？”格里高尔对着两边回答：“我准备好了。”他努力消除声音里的陌生感，吐字非常仔细，每个字之间都停顿很久。父亲回去吃早餐了，妹妹却低声说：“格里高尔，开门吧，求你了。”然而，格里高尔根本没想开门，反而庆幸自己旅行养成的谨慎习惯：晚上在家时也会锁门。



The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve themselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.

他想做的第一件事就是安心地起床，不受打扰，穿好衣服，最重要的是吃早餐。只有这样他才会考虑接下来该做什么，因为他很清楚，躺在床上无法让他的思绪得出任何合理的结论。他记得自己经常在床上感到轻微的疼痛，也许是因为躺得不舒服，但那总是纯粹是幻想，他想知道今天这些幻想会如何慢慢消散。他毫不怀疑，自己声音的变化只不过是重感冒的先兆，而重感冒是旅行推销员的职业病。



It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully. “This is something that can’t be done in bed”, Gregor said to himself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.

掀开被子很容易，他只需要稍微鼓起身体，被子就会自己掉下来。但之后就变得困难了，尤其是他体型如此魁梧。他本可以用胳膊和手撑起身子，但他用不着这些，只有那些小腿不停地朝不同方向移动，而且他无法控制它们。如果他想弯曲其中一条腿，那条腿就会先伸直；如果他终于用那条腿做了他想做的事，其他的腿似乎都被解放了，会痛苦地四处移动。“这种事在床上做不到，”格里高尔心想，“所以别再试了。”



The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.

他首先想到的是将下半身从床上抬起来，但是他从来没见过下半身，无法想象它是什么样子；动起来太费劲，而且速度很慢；最后，当他几乎疯狂地用尽全身的力气漫不经心地向前推时，他选错了方向，重重地撞在了床柱上，从他感觉到的灼痛中得知，他下半身可能是目前最敏感的。



So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first, carefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose consciousness.

于是，他试着先把上半身从床上抬起来，小心翼翼地把头转向一侧。他很轻松地做到了，尽管头又宽又重，但大部分身体最终还是慢慢地转向了头部。但当他终于把头从床上抬起来，呼吸到新鲜空气时，他突然想到，如果自己掉下去，头部没受伤才是奇迹，于是他不敢再用同样的方法向前推了。现在无论如何都不能让自己昏倒；与其失去意识，不如待在床上。



It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier, but when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as they struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was possible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time, though, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him. “Seven o’clock, already”, he said to himself when the clock struck again, “seven o’clock, and there’s still a fog like this.” And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state.

他费了同样的劲才回到刚才的位置，但当他躺在那里叹息，再次看着双腿比之前更加用力地挣扎时，他实在想不出任何办法能让这片混乱变得平静和有序。他再次告诉自己，他不可能一直躺在床上，最明智的做法就是不惜一切代价，用尽一切办法摆脱它。与此同时，他也不忘提醒自己，冷静的思考远比仓促下结论要好得多。在这种时候，他会把目光投向窗外，尽可能清晰地观察，但不幸的是，即使是狭窄街道的另一边也笼罩在晨雾之中，窗外的景色无法给他带来多少信心和欢欣。“已经七点了，”钟声再次敲响时，他自言自语道，“七点了，雾还是这么大。”他又静静地躺了一会儿，轻轻地呼吸着，仿佛期待着彻底的静止能让一切恢复到真实自然的状态。



But then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven I’ll definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody will have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me as well, as they open up at work before seven o’clock.” And so he set himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.

但随后他又对自己说：“七点一刻之前，我肯定得彻底起床。到时候肯定有人会下班过来问我怎么了，毕竟公司七点前就开门了。” 于是，他决定把整个身子同时甩到床外。如果他能这样从床上摔下来，并且保持头部抬起，大概就能避免受伤了。

His back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.

他的背看起来很硬，摔到地毯上应该不会有什么事。他最担心的是自己肯定会发出很大的响声，即使隔着所有的门，这响声也很可能引起人们的担忧，甚至惊慌。但这件事必须冒这个险。



When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed—the new method was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and forth—it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came to help him. Two strong people—he had his father and the maid in mind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.

当格里高尔已经半个身子露出床外时——新方法与其说是努力，不如说更像是游戏，他只需前后摇晃——他突然想到，如果有人来帮他，一切都会变得多么简单。两个力气大的人——他想到的是他的父亲和女仆——就足够了；他们只需用胳膊撑住他的后背，把他从床上拽起来，弯下腰扛着重物，然后耐心而小心地看着他摇晃到地板上，希望他的小腿能派上用场。

Should he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought.

就算所有门都锁着，他真的应该呼救吗？尽管他处境艰难，想到这里，他还是忍不住笑了。



After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. “That’ll be someone from work”, he said to himself, and froze very still, although his little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around.

过了一会儿，他已经挪得太远了，如果摇晃得太厉害，恐怕很难保持平衡。现在是七点十分，他很快就要做出最终决定了。这时，公寓门口响起了一阵铃声。“一定是公司的人来啦。”他心想，然后一动不动地站着，但他的小腿却跳得更加轻快了。

For a moment everything remained quiet. “They’re not opening the door”, Gregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of course, the maid’s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.

一时间，一切都安静了下来。“他们不会开门的。”格里高尔心想，心中燃起一丝荒谬的希望。然而，女仆坚定的脚步声一如既往地来到门口，打开了门。

Gregor only needed to hear the visitor’s first words of greeting and he knew who it was—the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees, every one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he couldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even necessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have to show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.

格里高尔只需听到来访者的第一句问候，便知道来者是谁——正是秘书主任本人。为什么格里高尔非得独自一人，被安排在一家稍有差池就立刻高度怀疑的公司里工作？难道所有员工，每个都是粗人吗？难道他们中就没一个忠心耿耿、尽职尽责的人，如果早上不花上至少几个小时处理公司事务，就会良心不安得发疯，甚至起不来床？难道让一个实习生去打听一下——假设有必要打听的话——还不够吗？难道秘书主任亲自前来，还要让整个无辜的家族知道，这件事非常可疑，只有秘书主任才有资格调查吗？与其说是做了什么正确的决定，不如说是这些想法让他心烦意乱，他用尽全身力气从床上跳了起来。

There was a loud thump, but it wasn’t really a loud noise. His fall was softened a little by the carpet, and Gregor’s back was also more elastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.

砰的一声巨响，但其实并不大。地毯稍微减轻了他摔倒的力道，格里高尔的背也比他想象的更有弹性，所以声音很轻，不太明显。可惜他没小心扶着头，摔倒时撞到了头；他又恼又疼，就把头翻过来，在地毯上蹭来蹭去。



“Something’s fallen down in there”, said the chief clerk in the room on the left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you had to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this question, the chief clerk’s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right, Gregor’s sister whispered to him to let him know: “Gregor, the chief clerk is here.” “Yes, I know”, said Gregor to himself; but without daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.

“里面有东西掉下来了，”左边房间里的书记官说。格里高尔努力想象今天发生在自己身上的事，会不会也发生在书记官身上；不得不承认，这的确有可能。但仿佛在粗声粗气地回答这个问题，隔壁房间里传来了书记官穿着擦得锃亮的靴子，坚定的脚步声。格里高尔的妹妹从右边的房间里低声通知他：“格里高尔，书记官来了。”“是的，我知道。”格里高尔自言自语道，但不敢大声说话，以免被妹妹听到。



“Gregor”, said his father now from the room to his left, “the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn’t leave on the early train. We don’t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to speak to you personally. So please open up this door. I’m sure he’ll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.” Then the chief clerk called “Good morning, Mr. Samsa”. “He isn’t well”, said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through the door. “He isn’t well, please believe me. Why else would Gregor have missed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he’s been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening. He sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. His idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He’s made a little frame, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you’ll be amazed how nice it is; it’s hanging up in his room; you’ll see it as soon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I’m glad you’re here; we wouldn’t have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves; he’s so stubborn; and I’m sure he isn’t well, he said this morning that he is, but he isn’t.” “I’ll be there in a moment”, said Gregor slowly and thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word of the conversation. “Well I can’t think of any other way of explaining it, Mrs. Samsa”, said the chief clerk, “I hope it’s nothing serious.

“格里高尔，”父亲这时从左边的房间里说道，“书记官过来了，想知道你为什么没坐早班火车走。我们不知道该怎么跟他说。而且，他想亲自和你谈谈。所以，请你开开这扇门。我相信他会体谅你房间的凌乱。”这时，书记官喊道：“早上好，萨姆沙先生。”“他身体不舒服，”母亲对书记官说，父亲则继续在门口说话。 “他身体不好，请相信我。不然格里高尔怎么会错过火车！这小子满脑子都是生意。他晚上从来不出门，这让我很生气；他来城里已经一个星期了，但每天晚上都待在家里。他和我们一起坐在厨房里，看看报纸，或者研究一下火车时刻表。他觉得放松的方式就是玩钢丝锯。比如说，他做了一个小画框，只花了两三个晚上，你会惊讶地发现它有多漂亮；它挂在他的房间里；格里高尔一开门你就会看到它。总之，我很高兴你来了；我们自己是没办法让格里高尔开门的；他太固执了；我肯定他身体不好，他今天早上说他身体好，但其实他不是。” “我马上就去。”格里高尔缓慢而若有所思地说，但他一动不动，以免错过谈话的每一个字。“嗯，萨姆沙太太，我想不出别的解释，”书记官长说，“我希望没什么大事。”

But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.” “Can the chief clerk come in to see you now then?”, asked his father impatiently, knocking at the door again. “No”, said Gregor. In the room on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry.

但另一方面，我必须说，如果我们这些经商之人身体稍有不适，那么，无论幸运还是不幸，我们都只能为了生意上的考虑而克服它。” “那么，书记长现在能进来见你吗？”父亲不耐烦地问道，又敲了敲门。“不行，”格里高尔说。他右边的房间里，一片沉闷的沉默；左边的房间里，他的妹妹哭了起来。



So why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she crying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that yet. Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family. For the time being he just lay there on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.

那么，为什么他妹妹不去和其他人一起呢？她大概才刚起床，还没开始穿衣服。她为什么哭？是不是因为他没起床，没让科长进来，因为他有丢掉工作的危险，如果那样的话，他的老板会再次对他们的父母提出同样的要求？现在还不需要担心这些。格里高尔还在那儿，丝毫没有抛弃家人的意思。他现在就躺在地毯上，任何了解他情况的人都不会真的指望他会开门。这只是一点小失礼，以后很容易找到合适的借口，格里高尔不能因此就被当场解雇。

And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the others didn’t know what was happening, they were worried, that would excuse their behaviour.

格里高尔觉得，现在让他安静一下，比跟他说话、哭闹来打扰他要明智得多。但其他人不知道发生了什么事，他们担心，这会成为他们行为的借口。



The chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr. Samsa”, he called to him, “what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more than yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary concern to your parents and you fail—and I mention this just by the way—you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of. I’m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. I am astonished, quite astonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and sensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims. This morning, your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear, it’s true—it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to you—but I came near to giving him my word of honour that that could not be the right explanation. But now that I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is your position all that secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you in private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I don’t see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it’s not the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that; but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr.

这时，书记员主任提高了嗓门，“萨姆沙先生，”他朝他喊道，“怎么了？你把自己关在房间里，只给我们一个‘是’或‘不是’的答案，你给父母带来了严重且不必要的担忧，而且你没有——我只是顺便提一下——你没有以前所未有的方式履行你的职责。我代表你的父母和你的雇主发言，真的必须要求你立即给出一个清晰的解释。我非常惊讶，非常惊讶。我以为你是个冷静理智的人，现在你却突然变得有些古怪，爱炫耀。今天早上，你的雇主确实提出了你没能出面的可能原因——这和最近托付给你的钱有关——但我差点就用人格担保，这不可能是真正的解释。但现在我看到你那令人费解的固执，我再也不想……为你求情。而且你的地位也并非那么稳固。我本来打算私下跟你说这些，但既然你让我无缘无故地在这里浪费时间，我不明白为什么你父母不应该知道。你最近的营业额很不理想；我承认现在不是生意特别好的时候，我们都知道这一点；但一年之中根本就没有完全不做生意的时候，先生。

Samsa, we cannot allow there to be.”

萨姆沙，我们不能允许这样的事情发生。”



“But Sir”, called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement, “I’ll open up immediately, just a moment. I’m slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven’t been able to get up. I’m still in bed now. I’m quite fresh again now, though. I’m just getting out of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It’s not quite as easy as I’d thought. I’m quite alright now, though. It’s shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last night already. They must have noticed it. I don’t know why I didn’t let you know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness without staying at home. Please, don’t make my parents suffer! There’s no basis for any of the accusations you’re making; nobody’s ever said a word to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven’t read the latest contracts I sent in. I’ll set off with the eight o’clock train, as well, these few hours of rest have given me strength. You don’t need to wait, sir; I’ll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!”

“可是先生，”格里高尔激动得忘乎所以，兴奋得忘乎所以地喊道，“我马上就开门，等一下。我有点不舒服，头有点晕，一直起不来。我现在还在床上。不过，我现在精神好了，正要起床。等一下。耐心点！事情不像我想象的那么容易。不过，我现在没事了。一个人怎么会突然发生这种事，真是令人震惊！我昨晚还好好的，我父母知道，也许他们比我还清楚，我昨晚就出现了一点症状。他们肯定注意到了。我不知道为什么我没有在公司告诉你！但你总觉得不用待在家里就能治好病。求你了，别让我父母受苦！你的这些指控毫无根据；从来没有人跟我说过这些事。也许你……我还没看我发过来的最新合同呢。我也坐八点的火车出发，这几个小时的休息让我恢复了体力。先生，您不用等了，我一会儿就到办公室，请您帮我转告老板，推荐我给他！”



And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was saying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers—this was easily done, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed—where he now tried to get himself upright. He really did want to open the door, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor’s responsibility and he could rest.

格里高尔一边滔滔不绝地说着这些话，几乎不知道自己在说什么，一边走到五斗橱前——这很容易做到，大概是因为他已经在床上练习过了——他现在正努力让自己站直。他真的想开门，真的想让他们看到他，想和秘书主任谈谈；其他人都这么坚持，他很想知道他们看到他会说什么。如果他们感到震惊，那就不再是格里高尔的责任了，他可以休息了。

If, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for eight o’clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.

不过，如果他们能冷静处理一切，他就没什么好生气的了，而且如果他抓紧时间，八点钟真的能到车站。最初几次，他试图爬上光滑的五斗橱，结果又滑了下去，但他终于用力地摇晃了一下，站直了身子；下半身疼得厉害，但他已经不在乎了。现在，他任由自己靠在旁边的一把椅背上，用小腿紧紧抓住椅背的边缘。这时，他也平静下来，保持安静，以便听取主任的讲话。



“Did you understand a word of all that?” the chief clerk asked his parents, “surely he’s not trying to make fools of us”. “Oh, God!”

“你们听懂了吗？”书记员问他的父母，“他肯定不是想捉弄我们吧？”“哦，天哪！”

called his mother, who was already in tears, “he could be seriously ill and we’re making him suffer. Grete! Grete!” she then cried. “Mother?”

“他妈妈！”他的母亲已经泪流满面地喊道，“他可能病得很重，我们却让他受苦。格雷特！格雷特！”她又哭了。“妈妈？”

his sister called from the other side. They communicated across Gregor’s room. “You’ll have to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor is ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just now?” “That was the voice of an animal”, said the chief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother’s screams. “Anna! Anna!”

他的妹妹在另一边喊道。他们隔着格里高尔的房间交流着。“你得马上去叫医生。格里高尔病了。快，快叫医生。你听到格里高尔刚才说话的声音了吗？”“那是动物的声音，”办事员说，语气平静，与他母亲的尖叫形成了鲜明对比。“安娜！安娜！”

his father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping his hands, “get a locksmith here, now!” And the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it open; people often do in homes where something awful has happened.

他父亲拍着手，从门厅冲进厨房喊道：“赶紧叫锁匠来！”两个女孩裙摆沙沙作响，立刻从走廊跑了出来，一边跑一边猛地打开了公寓的前门。他妹妹是怎么这么快就穿好衣服的？门关上的声音消失了；他们肯定把门敞开着；在发生过可怕事情的家里，人们经常会这样。



Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn’t understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than before—perhaps his ears had become used to the sound.

相比之下，格里高尔平静多了。所以他们再也听不懂他的话了，尽管他觉得这些话足够清晰，比以前更清晰——或许他的耳朵已经习惯了这种声音。

They had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help. The first response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements—although he did not really distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he coughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had become very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed against the door and listening.

不过，他们意识到他有点不对劲，准备伸出援手。他们对他处境的第一反应是自信而明智的，这让他感觉好了一些。他感觉自己又回到了人群中，他期待着医生和锁匠能带来意想不到的伟大成就——尽管他其实分不清他们之间有什么区别。接下来要说什么都至关重要，所以，为了尽可能让自己的声音清晰，他轻轻咳嗽了一下，但注意不要太大声，因为即使是这样，听起来也可能和人类咳嗽的声音大相径庭，他不再确定自己能否判断。与此同时，隔壁房间里一片寂静。也许他的父母正坐在桌边和书记员低声交谈，也许他们都贴着门偷听。



Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth—how was he, then, to grasp the key?—but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor. “Listen”, said the chief clerk in the next room, “he’s turning the key.” Gregor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his mother too: “Well done, Gregor”, they should have cried, “keep at it, keep hold of the lock!” And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was Gregor’s sign that he could break his concentration, and as he regained his breath he said to himself: “So, I didn’t need the locksmith after all”. Then he lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely.

格里高尔缓缓地推开椅子，走到门口。到了门口，他松开椅子，猛地扑到门上，用腿尖上的粘合剂撑住身体。他休息了一会儿，缓过劲儿来，然后开始用嘴转动锁里的钥匙。可惜的是，他似乎没有牙齿——那么，他怎么抓住钥匙呢？——不过，他那强壮的下巴当然弥补了牙齿的不足；他真的用下巴转动了钥匙，完全不顾自己嘴里肯定弄坏了什么，因为一股棕色的液体从他嘴里流出来，流过钥匙，滴落在地板上。“听，”隔壁的办事员说，“他转动钥匙了。”格里高尔听后大受鼓舞；但他们都应该冲他喊，包括他的父母：“干得好，格里高尔，”他们应该喊，“坚持住，抓住锁！”他以为大家都在兴奋地看着他努力，于是用尽全力咬住钥匙，丝毫不顾自己造成的疼痛。钥匙转动时，他用钥匙绕着锁转了一圈，只用嘴支撑身体，根据需要，用整个身体的重量抓住钥匙或将其推回。锁扣回时发出的清脆声响，是格里高尔可以打断注意力的信号。等他恢复呼吸，他自言自语道：“原来如此，我根本不需要锁匠。”然后，他把头靠在门把手上，把门完全打开了。



Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open before he could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the room. He was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud “Oh!”, which sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him—he was the nearest to the door—his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.

因为他必须这样开门，门还没等他被看到，就已经大开着了。他得先慢慢地绕过一扇双开门，而且必须非常小心，以免还没进门就摔个仰面朝天。他正专心致志地做着这个艰难的动作，根本没空注意其他事情，这时他听到书记官长一声惊呼，如同风的呼啸。这时他也看到了书记官长——他离门最近——捂着张开的嘴的手，缓缓地往后缩，仿佛被一股无形的、持续不断的力量驱使着。

Gregor’s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk’s being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.

格里高尔的母亲，尽管书记官在场，头发却依然凌乱，她看着格里高尔的父亲。然后她张开双臂，朝格里高尔走了两步，瘫倒在地板上，裙子散开，她的头垂到胸前。格里高尔的父亲满脸敌意，握紧拳头，仿佛要把格里高尔打回房间。

Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.

然后他茫然地环顾客厅，用手捂住眼睛，哭得胸膛都颤抖起来。



So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half of his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its façade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for Gregor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below.

于是格里高尔没进房间，而是倚在另一扇门的内侧，门仍然插着栓。这样，只能看到他半个身子，头探出头来，向外张望。这时，天色已经亮了不少；街对面那栋一望无际的灰黑色建筑——那是一家医院——的一部分清晰可见，透过一排排简朴而规整的窗户，映入眼帘；雨还在下，大颗大颗的雨滴落在地上。早餐洗好的东西堆放在桌子上；之所以堆得这么多，是因为对格里高尔的父亲来说，早餐是一天中最重要的一餐，他会坐在那里读好几份报纸，一口气吃上好几个小时。正对面的墙上挂着格里高尔在陆军中尉时期的照片，他手握长剑，脸上挂着无忧无虑的笑容，令人对他的制服和举止肃然起敬。通往门厅的门开着，公寓的前门也开着，他能看到楼梯平台和他们下楼的楼梯。



“Now, then”, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have kept calm, “I’ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and set off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see”, he said to the chief clerk, “that I’m not stubborn and I like to do my job; being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn’t earn my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you report everything accurately, then? It’s quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work, but that’s just the right time to remember what’s been achieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration. You’re well aware that I’m seriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my parents and my sister, so that I’m trapped in a difficult situation, but I will work my way out of it again. Please don’t make things any harder for me than they are already, and don’t take sides against me at the office. I know that nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That’s just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss himself—it’s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And you’re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it’s almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don’t usually even hear about them, or if at all it’s when we arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that’s when we feel the harmful effects of what’s been going on without even knowing what caused them. Please, don’t go away, at least first say something to show that you grant that I’m at least partly right!”

“好了，”格里高尔说，他很清楚自己是唯一一个保持冷静的人，“我马上穿好衣服，打包好样品，出发。请让我走好吗？你看得出来，”他对主管说，“我并不固执，而且我喜欢我的工作；做一名旅行专员很辛苦，但如果不旅行，我就无法维持生计。那么，你要去哪里？去办公室吗？什么事？你能如实汇报吗？一个人可能会暂时无法工作，但这正是回顾过去所取得的成就，并考虑到以后困难消除后，他一定会更加勤奋专注地工作。你很清楚，我欠了雇主很多债，还要照顾我的父母和妹妹，所以我现在处境很艰难，但我会再次努力摆脱困境。请不要再让我的情况变得更糟了。”别在办公室里跟我作对。我知道没人喜欢出差的人。他们认为我们挣着高薪，却过着优哉游哉的生活。这只是偏见，但他们也没什么理由不这么想。但是，先生，您比其他员工更了解情况，事实上，如果我可以私下说，您比老板本人更了解情况——像他这样的商人很容易对员工犯错，对他们的评价也过于严厉。您也很清楚，我们这些出差的人几乎一年到头都不在办公室，所以很容易成为流言蜚语、意外事件和无端抱怨的受害者，几乎不可能免受这类事情的困扰，我们通常甚至听不到这些，或者即使听到，也是在旅途劳顿回到家时，那时我们才会感受到这些事情带来的负面影响，甚至不知道是什么原因造成的。请不要走开，至少先说点什么，表明这一点。你承认我至少有一部分是对的！”



But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment while Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural force waiting to save him.

格里高尔刚开口说话，秘书主任就转过身去，撅着嘴，只是从颤抖的肩膀上方回头看着他离开。格里高尔说话时，秘书主任一刻不停，目不转睛地朝着门口走去。他动作非常缓慢，仿佛有什么秘密禁令禁止他离开房间。直到走到门厅，他才突然动身，从客厅里抽出脚，慌乱地向前冲去。在走廊里，他把右手伸向楼梯，仿佛那里有什么超自然的力量在等着拯救他。



Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger. That was something his parents did not understand very well; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for the future. Gregor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the future of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his sister were here! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was not there, Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state, or that his speech still might not—or probably would not—be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself through the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who, ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but Gregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought something to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs. Hardly had that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them; to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there on the floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: “Help, for pity’s sake, Help!” The way she held her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.

格里高尔意识到，如果不想让秘书主任在公司里的地位岌岌可危，就绝对不能让他心情不好地离开。这一点他的父母不太理解；多年来，他们一直坚信这份工作能养活格里高尔一辈子，而且，他们现在有太多事情要操心，完全没有考虑未来。然而，格里高尔却考虑未来。他必须劝住秘书主任，让他冷静下来，说服他，最终赢得他的信任；格里高尔和他家人的未来都取决于此！要是他姐姐在就好了！她很聪明；格里高尔还安安静静地躺着的时候，她就已经泪流满面了。而且秘书主任是个爱女人的人，她肯定能说服他；她会关上门厅的前门，让他从震惊的状态中走出来。可是他姐姐不在，格里高尔只好自己动手了。他丝毫没有考虑自己还不熟悉自己现在的状态，也顾不上自己的话可能还听不懂——或者很可能听不懂——就松开了门，挤了出去，想去楼梯平台上的书记长那里，可笑的是，他正双手扶着栏杆；格里高尔却立刻摔倒了，他想抓住什么东西，尖叫一声，落在了无数条小腿上。这才刚一落地，他那天第一次感觉身体舒服了起来；小腿踩在坚实的地面上；让他高兴的是，它们完全按照他的吩咐去做事；它们甚至还努力地把他带到他想去的地方；他很快就相信，所有的悲伤都快要结束了。他强忍着想动的冲动，蜷缩在地板上，身体左右摇晃。母亲就在他前面不远处，起初似乎全神贯注，但随后她突然跳起来，张开双臂，手指张开，大喊：“救命啊，可怜可怜我吧，救命啊！”她昂着头的样子表明她想更好地看看格里高尔，但她不假思索地向后退的样子表明她并不想看得更清楚；她忘记了身后的桌子，上面摆满了早餐用具；当她走到桌子旁时，她迅速坐了下来，却不知道自己在做什么；甚至似乎没有注意到咖啡壶被打翻了，一股咖啡喷洒在地毯上。



“Mother, mother”, said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of coffee. That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her. Gregor, though, had no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for the last time. Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all around the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor’s father into a panic as well. Until then he had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running after the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him, Gregor’s father seized the chief clerk’s stick in his right hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with his hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with his left, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping his foot at him as he went. Gregor’s appeals to his father were of no help, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.

“妈妈，妈妈。”格里高尔抬头看着她，温柔地叫道。他一时完全忘记了书记官，但看到咖啡流淌而出，忍不住张大嘴巴。母亲这才再次尖叫起来，她从桌子旁逃开，扑进了父亲的怀抱，父亲则冲了过去。格里高尔现在没时间照顾父母了；书记官已经跑到楼梯口；他下巴抵着楼梯扶手，最后一次回头看了一眼。格里高尔拼命地追过去；他想确保自己能追上他；书记官肯定有所预料，一下子跳下几级台阶，消失了踪影；他的喊叫声响彻整个楼梯。不幸的是，书记官的逃跑似乎也让格里高尔的父亲惊慌失措。此前，格里高尔一直比较克制自己，但现在，他不再亲自追赶书记长，至少没有在格里高尔追赶时拦住他，而是用右手抓住书记长的手杖（书记长把它连同他的帽子和大衣一起放在椅子上），用左手从桌上抓起一份厚报纸，用这两样东西把格里高尔赶回房间，一边走一边跺脚。格里高尔向父亲求助毫无用处，他的求助根本无人理会，无论他如何谦卑地转过头，父亲只会跺得更厉害。

Across the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor’s mother had pulled open a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor’s father as he drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. Gregor had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father’s hand any moment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that he had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn himself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as to which way to turn. If only his father would stop that unbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused. When he had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come. He was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.

房间的另一边，尽管天气寒冷，格里高尔的母亲还是拉开了一扇窗户，探出长长的身子，用手捂住脸。一股强劲的风从街上吹向楼梯，窗帘被掀了起来，桌上的报纸被吹得飘动，有些被吹落到地上。格里高尔的父亲像个野人一样，冲着他发出嘶嘶声，把他往后赶，什么也拦不住。格里高尔从来没有练习过后退，只能走得很慢。如果格里高尔能转身，他就能立刻回到房间，但他担心，如果他再转身，父亲会不耐烦，而且随时都有可能被父亲手中的棍子狠狠地打到他的背或头上。然而，格里高尔最终意识到自己别无选择，因为他厌恶地发现自己根本无法直线后退；于是他开始尽可能快地转身，不时焦急地瞥向父亲。转得非常慢，但父亲或许看出了他的好意，所以没有阻拦他，事实上，他还不时用拐杖的尖端远远地指点着该往哪个方向转。要是父亲别再发出那令人难以忍受的嘶嘶声就好了！格里高尔正被这嘶嘶声弄得不知所措。他几乎转完身，仍然听着嘶嘶声，却犯了一个错误，沿着刚才的方向稍微折回了一点。终于把头伸到门口时，他很高兴，但随后发现门口太窄，他的身子又太宽，要穿过去就更加困难了。在父亲现在的心情下，显然没有想到打开另一扇双开门，好让格里高尔有足够的空间通过。他一心想着格里高尔应该尽快回到自己的房间。他也不会给格里高尔时间站直身体，为穿过门口做准备。

What he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it, soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from where he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into his room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all was quiet.

他的动作比以往更加响亮，格里高尔仿佛什么也没有挡着，更加用力地向前冲去；格里高尔听来，仿佛身后站着不止一个父亲；这可不是什么愉快的经历，格里高尔不顾一切地把自己推到门口。他身体的一侧抬起来，斜躺在门口，一侧的肋部擦到了白色的门，留下了难看的棕色划痕，很快他就被牢牢地卡住了，根本动弹不得。一侧的小腿悬在空中颤抖，另一侧的小腿则痛苦地贴着地面。这时，父亲从后面用力推了他一下，把他从被抓住的地方推了出来，他飞了出去，血流满面，深深地坠入房间。门被棍子砰地关上，然后，一切终于安静了下来。

二


It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke from his deep and coma-like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadn’t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested. But he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him. The light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae—of which he was now beginning to learn the value—in order to see what had been happening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning—it was nearly a miracle that only one of them had been—and dragged along lifelessly.

直到傍晚天色渐暗，格里高尔才从昏睡般的沉睡中醒来。即使没有被打扰，他也很快就会醒，因为他已经睡够了，感觉休息得很好。但他感觉是一阵急促的脚步声和通往前屋的门被小心翼翼关上的声音把他吵醒了。路灯的微弱光线不时地照射在天花板和家具顶部，但格里高尔所在的地方，却一片漆黑。他费力地走到门口，笨拙地摸索着触角——他现在开始体会到触角的价值了——想看看那里发生了什么。他的整个左侧身体就像一道被拉长、疼痛的伤疤，他的两排腿一瘸一拐地走着。其中一条腿在那天早上的事件中受了重伤——几乎是个奇迹，只有一条腿受了伤——他无力地被拖着走。



It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it actually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of something to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. He was so pleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been that morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly covering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head back again in disappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it difficult to eat the food—he was only able to eat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole—but the milk did not taste at all nice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister had certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned, almost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room.

直到走到门口，他才意识到是什么把他吸引过来；是食物的香味。门边放着一个盘子，盛满了加糖的牛奶，上面漂浮着一些碎白面包。他高兴得差点笑出来，因为他比早上饿多了。他立刻把头伸进牛奶里，牛奶差点遮住了他的眼睛。但他很快又失望地缩回了头；不仅因为他左侧的疼痛让他难以进食——他只有整个身体像一个整体一样抽着鼻子才能吃东西——而且这牛奶的味道一点也不好。像这样的牛奶通常是他最喜欢的饮料，他姐姐肯定就是因为这个才把牛奶留在那里给他的，但他几乎违背自己的意愿，转过身，从盘子旁爬回房间中央。



Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been lit in the living room. His father at this time would normally be sat with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor’s mother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to be heard. Gregor’s sister would often write and tell him about this reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. It was so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody in the flat. “What a quiet life it is the family lead”, said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and parents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that Gregor did not want to think about too much, so he started to move about, crawling up and down the room.

透过门缝，格里高尔看到客厅里的煤气灯已经点亮。平时这个时候，父亲会坐在那里，大声地读晚报给格里高尔的母亲听，有时也给妹妹听，但现在却听不到一点声音。格里高尔的妹妹经常写信告诉他读书的事，但也许父亲最近已经失去了这个习惯。四周一片寂静，尽管公寓里肯定有人。“这个家过着多么平静的生活啊！”格里高尔心想，凝视着黑暗，为自己能在如此美好的家中为妹妹和父母提供这样的生活而感到无比自豪。可是，如果这一切平静、富足和舒适最终以可怕而恐怖的结局收场，那该怎么办呢？格里高尔不愿多想，于是他开始四处走动，在房间里爬来爬去。



Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited in vain. The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him, but now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides.

在那个漫长的夜晚，房间一侧的门曾被轻轻打开过一次，又匆匆关上；后来，另一侧的门也开了一条缝；看来有人需要进房间，但又想了想，还是算了。格里高尔立刻走到门口等着，决心要么想办法把这位胆怯的访客带进来，要么至少打听一下来人是谁；但那天晚上门再也没开过，格里高尔徒劳地等待着。前一天早上，门锁着的时候，大家都想进去见他，但现在，他已经打开了一扇门，而另一扇门显然在白天的某个时候被打开过，却没有人来，钥匙却在另一侧。



It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come into Gregor’s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.

直到深夜，客厅里的煤气灯才熄灭。现在，他父母和妹妹显然一直没睡，因为他们踮着脚尖一起走开时，声音清晰可闻。显然，直到早上，都不会再有人进格里高尔的房间了；这让他有充足的时间安心思考如何重新安排自己的生活。

For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he had been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch. It pressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift his head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.

不知为何，被迫待在这间高大空旷的房间里，让他感到一阵不安，尽管他已经在里面住了五年，却还是平躺在地板上。除了一丝羞愧之外，他几乎意识不到自己在做什么，赶紧钻到沙发底下。沙发稍微压在他的背上，让他抬不起头，但他还是立刻感到轻松自在，唯一的遗憾是他的身躯太宽，没法把沙发全部塞进去。



He spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being he must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced to impose on them.

他在那里度过了一整夜。有时他睡得很浅，尽管他经常因为饥饿而惊醒；有时他又在担忧和渺茫的希望中度过，但这些希望最终都指向同一个结论：目前他必须保持冷静，必须表现出耐心和最大的体贴，以便他的家人能够承受他以目前的状态强加给他们的不愉快。



Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when she did notice him under the couch—he had to be somewhere, for God’s sake, he couldn’t have flown away—she was so shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut again from outside. But she seemed to regret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left the milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn’t do it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it, although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch, throw himself at his sister’s feet and beg her for something good to eat. However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise. She immediately picked it up—using a rag, not her bare hands—and carried it out. Gregor was extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did bring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had declared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor’s use, and placed it beside them. Then, out of consideration for Gregor’s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her, she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he liked. Gregor’s little legs whirred, at last he could eat. What’s more, his injuries must already have completely healed as he found no difficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday. “Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?”, he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much more than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another, his eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn’t like at all, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them because he couldn’t stand the smell. Long after he had finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly turned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw. He was immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he hurried back under the couch. But he needed great self-control to stay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room, as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could hardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more. She quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out.

格里高尔很快就有机会检验自己决定的力度了。第二天清晨，几乎在夜幕降临之前，他妹妹几乎衣冠楚楚，从前屋打开门，焦急地往里张望。她没有立刻看到他，但当她注意到他藏在沙发底下时——他肯定在某个地方，我的天哪，他不可能飞走了——她惊得失去了控制，从外面砰地一声关上了门。但她似乎后悔了自己的行为，她立刻又打开了门，踮着脚尖走了进来，仿佛走进了一个重病患者的房间，甚至是一个陌生人的房间。格里高尔把头探到沙发边上，注视着她。她会不会注意到他把牛奶放在那里，意识到他并非因为不饿，然后给他拿些更合适的食物来？如果她不亲自做，他宁愿饿肚子也不愿引起她的注意，尽管他当时真想从沙发底下冲上前去，扑倒在姐姐脚边，乞求她给他点好吃的。然而，姐姐立刻注意到了那盘满满的食物，她惊讶地看着盘子和溅在盘子周围的几滴牛奶。她立刻拿起盘子——用的是一块抹布，而不是赤手——然后走了出去。格里高尔非常好奇她会拿什么来代替它，他想象着各种可能性，但他怎么也猜不到，好心的姐姐真的拿来了什么。为了试探他的口味，她拿来各种各样的东西，都铺在一张旧报纸上。有半腐烂的蔬菜；晚餐剩下的骨头，上面淋着变硬的白酱；几颗葡萄干和杏仁；一些格里高尔两天前就说不能吃的奶酪；一个干面包卷和一些涂着黄油和盐的面包。除此之外，她还在盘子里倒了些水，这盘子大概是专门为格里高尔准备的，然后放在他们旁边。然后，出于对格里高尔感受的考虑，因为她知道他不会当着她的面吃东西，她赶紧又出去了，甚至转动了锁上的钥匙，让格里高尔知道他可以随心所欲地吃东西。格里高尔的小腿发出嗡嗡的声音，终于可以吃了。而且，他的伤一定已经完全好了，因为他行动起来毫无困难。这让他很惊讶，因为一个多月前，他的手指被刀子轻轻割伤了，他想起前天手指还在疼。“这么说，我现在不像以前那么敏感了？”他想着，已经开始贪婪地吮吸奶酪了。这东西立刻就吸引了他，几乎是不可抗拒的，比报纸上的其他食物更吸引他。他一口接一口地吃着奶酪、蔬菜和酱汁，眼里噙满了喜悦；另一方面，他一点也不喜欢新鲜的食物，甚至会把想吃的东西拖得离它们远一点，因为他受不了那股味道。吃完饭后，他懒洋洋地躺在原地很久，姐姐才慢慢地转动锁上的钥匙，示意他应该撤退了。尽管他当时半睡半醒，但他立刻吓了一跳，赶紧躲回沙发底下。但即使姐姐在房间里待了那么短的时间，他也需要极大的自制力才能待在那里，因为吃了这么多东西，他的身体也变得有点圆润，在那个狭小的空间里他几乎喘不过气来。他几乎快要窒息了，他瞪大了眼睛看着姐姐下意识地拿起扫帚扫起剩菜，把它们和他根本没碰过的食物混在一起，仿佛这些东西已经吃不下去了。她迅速地把所有东西都扔进垃圾桶，盖上木盖，然后把所有东西都搬了出去。

She had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched himself.

她刚一转身，格里高尔就从沙发底下钻了出来，伸了个懒腰。



This was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning while his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would sleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor’s sister would send the maid away on some errand. Gregor’s father and mother certainly did not want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than they could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.

格里高尔现在每天就是这样吃饭的：早上一次，父母和女仆还在睡觉的时候；中午大家吃完饭后再一次，因为那时父母也会睡一会儿，格里高尔的姐姐会打发女仆出去办事。格里高尔的父母当然也不想让他饿死，但除了被告知之外，他们或许更难以忍受亲身体验格里高尔吃饭的过程，或许他的姐姐也想尽量减轻他们的痛苦，因为他们已经够痛苦的了。



It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. As nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that he could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister’s sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was only later, when she had become a little more used to everything—there was, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the situation—that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly. “He’s enjoyed his dinner today”, she might say when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became more and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, “now everything’s just been left there again”.

格里高尔根本无法弄清楚第一天早上他们究竟跟医生和锁匠说了什么，好让他们离开公寓。因为没人听得懂他的话，也没人，甚至连他姐姐也不认为他能听懂他们的话，所以他只能满足于听着姐姐在他房间里走动时发出的叹息和对圣徒的祈求。直到后来，当她对一切都稍微习惯了一点——当然，她永远不可能完全适应这种情况——格里高尔才偶尔听到一句友好的评论，或者至少是一句可以被理解为友好的评论。“他今天吃得很开心”，当他勤快地把剩下的食物都收拾好时，她可能会这么说；或者，如果他把大部分食物都留在那里——这种情况慢慢变得越来越频繁——她常常会悲伤地说：“现在所有东西都又被放在那里了。”



Although Gregor wasn’t able to hear any news directly he did listen to much of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard anyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his whole body against it. There was seldom any conversation, especially at first, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret. For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they should do now; but even between meals they spoke about the same subject as there were always at least two members of the family at home—nobody wanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty. And on the very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged Gregor’s mother to let her go without delay. It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor’s mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service.

格里高尔虽然没能直接听到任何消息，但他确实听到了隔壁房间里的很多谈话。每当听到有人说话，他就会径直冲向相应的门，用整个身子贴住门。他们几乎没有什么谈话，尤其是在刚开始的时候，不和他扯上关系，哪怕只是偷偷地聊。整整两天，每顿饭前的谈话都是关于他们现在该怎么办；但即使在两餐之间，他们也谈论着同一个话题，因为家里至少有两位家庭成员——谁也不想独自在家，而且绝对不可能让公寓完全空着。第一天，女佣就跪下来恳求格里高尔的母亲让她赶紧离开。不清楚她对发生的事情了解多少，但她不到一刻钟就离开了，泪流满面地感谢格里高尔的母亲让她离开，仿佛她帮了她一个大忙。

She even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.

她甚至郑重发誓，不会告诉任何人所发生的事，尽管没有人问过她。



Now Gregor’s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking; although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much. Gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat, and receive no more answer than “no thanks, I’ve had enough” or something similar. No-one drank very much either. His sister would sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the chance to go and fetch it herself. When his father then said nothing she would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send the housekeeper for it, but then his father would close the matter with a big, loud “No”, and no more would be said.

现在格里高尔的姐姐也得帮妈妈做饭；不过这也不算太麻烦，因为大家都吃得不多。格里高尔经常听到他们中的一个劝另一个吃饭，却总是徒劳无功，得到的回答也不过是“不用了，我吃饱了”之类的话。而且大家都不怎么喝酒。他姐姐有时会问父亲想不想喝啤酒，希望能有机会自己去拿。父亲什么也没说，她便会补充几句，以免父亲觉得她自私，好让她派管家去拿，但父亲随后就会大声地喊一声“不”，就此打住，再也不说话了。



Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained to Gregor’s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were.

甚至在第一天结束之前，他的父亲就已经向格里高尔的母亲和妹妹解释了她们的财务状况和前景。

Now and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from his business when it had collapsed five years earlier. Gregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he wanted. What he heard his father say was some of the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room. He had thought that nothing at all remained from his father’s business, at least he had never told him anything different, and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway. Their business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total despair, and Gregor’s only concern at that time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it as quickly as possible. So then he started working especially hard, with a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance to earn money in quite different ways. Gregor converted his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished and delighted family. They had been good times and they had never come again, at least not with the same splendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was no longer much warm affection given in return. Gregor only remained close to his sister now. Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist, it was his secret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some other way. During Gregor’s short periods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised. Their parents did not like to hear this innocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day.

他不时地从桌边站起身，从五年前生意倒闭时留下的小钱箱里拿出一些收据或文件。格里高尔听着他如何打开那把复杂的锁，取出想要的东西后又重新锁上。他听到父亲说的话，是格里高尔被关在房间里以来听到的第一个好消息。他原以为父亲的生意已经荡然无存，至少父亲从未告诉过他任何不同的事情，格里高尔也从未问过他。生意上的倒霉事让全家陷入了彻底的绝望，格里高尔当时唯一关心的就是安排好一切，好让他们尽快忘掉这件事。于是，他开始格外卖力地工作，干劲十足，几乎一夜之间就从初级销售员一跃成为旅行销售员，也因此获得了以各种方式赚钱的机会。格里高尔将工作上的成功直接转化为现金，摆在家里的桌子上，让他的家人既惊讶又欣喜。那些美好的时光一去不复返，至少没有像以前那样辉煌，尽管格里高尔后来赚了很多钱，足以负担全家的生活开销，而且他也确实承担了。格里高尔和家人甚至都习惯了，他们感激地接受金钱，格里高尔也乐于提供，尽管他不再给予他们多少温暖的关爱。格里高尔现在只和妹妹保持着亲密的关系。与他不同，妹妹热爱音乐，是一位天赋异禀、富有表现力的小提琴手。他秘密计划明年送她去音乐学院，即使这会花费不菲，最终不得不通过其他方式弥补。格里高尔在城里短暂的停留期间，和妹妹的谈话经常会转到音乐学院，但这只是他一个永远无法实现的美好梦想。他们的父母不喜欢听到这种天真的谈话，但格里高尔深思熟虑后，决定在圣诞节那天隆重地宣布他的计划。



That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind in his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.

在他现在正贴着门听着的时候，脑子里闪过这种毫无意义的想法。

There were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening, when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all go silent. “What’s that he’s doing now”, his father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.

有时候，他实在太累了，听不下去了，头会无力地靠在门上，然后猛地把头抬起来，因为他发出的任何一点动静，隔壁都能听到，然后大家都安静下来。“他现在在干什么呢？”过了一会儿，他父亲会问，显然他已经走到门口了。这时，被打断的谈话才会慢慢地被接起来。



When explaining things, his father repeated himself several times, partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these matters himself and partly because Gregor’s mother did not understand everything the first time. From these repeated explanations Gregor learned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days. It was not a lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated.

父亲解释事情时，总是重复好几次，一部分是因为他很久没亲自处理过这些事情了，一部分是因为格里高尔的母亲第一次并没有完全听懂。格里高尔欣喜地从这些重复的解释中得知，尽管他们经历了种种不幸，但过去留下的钱还剩下一些。虽然不多，但这段时间一直没动用，而且还积累了一些利息。

Besides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had been bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution.

除此之外，他们并没有把格里高尔每个月带回家的钱全部用完，只给自己留了一点，所以这笔钱也一直在积累。格里高尔在门后，为这出乎意料的节俭和谨慎而欣喜地点了点头。

He could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father’s debt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better the way his father had done things.

他实际上可以用这笔剩余的钱来减少他父亲欠老板的债务，而他摆脱那份工作的日子也会更近一步，但现在他父亲的做法肯定更好。



This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one or two years, no more. That’s to say, it was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies; money to live on had to be earned. His father was healthy but old, and lacking in self confidence. During the five years that he had not been working—the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success—he had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. Would Gregor’s elderly mother now have to go and earn money? She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home, every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window. Would his sister have to go and earn money? She was still a child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin. Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money, Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot with shame and regret.

然而，这些钱肯定不足以靠利息维持一家人的生活；或许只能维持一两年，不会更多。也就是说，这些钱不应该真正动用，而应该留着以备不时之需；生活费必须自己挣。他的父亲身体健康，但年事已高，缺乏自信。在他五年没有工作——这是他充满压力却毫无成就的人生中第一次休假——期间，他体重增加了很多，变得行动迟缓、笨手笨脚。格里高尔年迈的母亲现在难道不得不出去赚钱了吗？她患有哮喘，在家里走动都让她很吃力，每隔一天就得在敞开的窗边的沙发上喘着粗气。他的妹妹也不得不出去赚钱吗？她当时还是个十七岁的孩子，之前的生活令人羡慕，包括穿着漂亮的衣服，睡到很晚，帮忙做生意，参加一些简单的娱乐活动，最重要的是拉小提琴。每当他们开始谈论需要赚钱时，格里高尔总是先放开门，然后把自己扔到旁边凉爽的皮沙发上，因为他因羞愧和后悔而浑身发热。



He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end. Or he might go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it.

他常常整晚躺在那里，一夜不眠，连续几个小时挠着皮革。或者，他会费尽心思把椅子推到窗边，爬上窗台，撑在椅子上，倚着窗台，凝视着窗外。

He had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as what he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day, even things that were quite near; he had used to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at all, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on.

他以前这样做时，总能感受到无比的自由，但现在这样做显然更像是一种回忆，而非亲身体验。因为他以这种方式看到的东西，甚至连近在咫尺的事物都一天比一天模糊；他以前总是咒骂街对面医院的景象，但现在却完全看不见了。如果不是他知道自己住在夏洛滕大街——这条街虽然位于市中心，但却十分安静——他甚至会以为自己正看着窗外一片荒芜的荒原，灰色的天空和灰色的大地浑然一体。他那细心的妹妹只需注意到那把椅子两次，就会在整理房间后，把它推回窗边的原位，甚至从此以后，窗户的内侧玻璃就一直开着。



If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it; but as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much better. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into Gregor’s room, then she would go straight to the window and pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it was cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while. She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while, knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him with the windows closed.

如果格里高尔能和妹妹说话，感谢她为他所做的一切，他就能好受些；但事实就是如此，这让他很痛苦。妹妹自然尽量装作若无其事，时间拖得越长，她就越能装得若无其事，但随着时间的推移，格里高尔也看透了这一切。现在，每当她进房间时，他甚至都感到很不舒服。她一进门，便会迅速关上门，以防万一有人看到格里高尔的房间，然后径直走到窗前，像快要窒息一样迅速拉开窗。即使天气很冷，她也会站在窗边深呼吸一会儿。她每天会跑来跑去两次，吵闹不休，把格里高尔吓得魂飞魄散；他会一直躲在沙发底下瑟瑟发抖，他很清楚她肯定希望他免受这种折磨，但她不可能和他待在关着窗户的同一个房间里。



One day, about a month after Gregor’s transformation when his sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most horrible. In itself, his sister’s not coming into the room would have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still there, but not only did she not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite her. Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course, but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she still found his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to spare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely. She left the sheet where it was. Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his sister liked the new arrangement.

格里高尔变形后大约一个月，他的妹妹也不再对他的出现感到特别震惊。有一天，她比平时早进了房间，发现他仍然盯着窗外，一动不动，而这正是他最可怕的地方。妹妹不进房间本身对格里高尔来说并不意外，因为格里高尔还在的时候，妹妹很难立刻打开窗户。但她不仅没有进来，还直接回去关上了门，陌生人肯定会以为他威胁了她，想咬她。格里高尔当然直接躲到了沙发底下，但他不得不等到中午妹妹才回来，而妹妹似乎比平时更加不安。这让他意识到，妹妹仍然无法忍受他的出现，而且会一直这样下去，甚至看到他从沙发底下露出的那点身影时，她可能不得不克制住逃跑的冲动。有一天，为了不让她看到这一幕，他花了四个小时把床单仰面搬到沙发上，铺好后把自己完全盖住，妹妹即使弯腰也看不见。如果妹妹觉得没必要盖床单，那她只需把它拿掉就行了，因为格里高尔显然不想把自己完全隔绝开来。她把床单放在了原处。格里高尔甚至有一次小心翼翼地从床单下探出头来，看看妹妹是否喜欢这种新安排，甚至觉得瞥见了妹妹感激的目光。



For the first fourteen days, Gregor’s parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to see him. He would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor’s room while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded her against it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and approved fully. Later, though, she had to be held back by force, which made her call out: “Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son!

最初的十四天里，格里高尔的父母都不愿进房间看他。他经常听到他们说，他们很欣赏妹妹所做的一切新工作，尽管以前他们一直把她看作一个没用的女孩，经常被她惹恼。但现在，他们俩，爸爸妈妈，经常会一起守在格里高尔房间的门外，等着妹妹收拾房间。妹妹一出去，就得把房间的布置一五一十地告诉他们，格里高尔吃了什么，这次表现如何，以及他是否能稍微好转一些。母亲也想尽快进去看看格里高尔，但父亲和妹妹一开始劝她不要这么做。格里高尔认真地听着这一切，并完全同意了。但后来，她不得不被强行拦住，这让她大声喊道：“让我去看看格里高尔，他是我可怜的儿子！”

Can’t you understand I have to see him?”, and Gregor would think to himself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every day of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand everything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was still just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult’s appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.

难道你不明白我必须见他吗？”格里高尔心里想，也许他妈妈来会更好，当然不是每天都来，但也许一周来一天；她比他的妹妹更能理解一切，他的妹妹虽然很勇敢，但毕竟还是个孩子，可能真的没有成年人能体会到她所承担的繁重工作。



Gregor’s wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his food soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling. He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was quite different from lying on the floor; he could breathe more freely; his body had a light swing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost happy, it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash. But now, of course, he had far better control of his body than before and, even with a fall as great as that, caused himself no damage. Very soon his sister noticed Gregor’s new way of entertaining himself—he had, after all, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about—and got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing the furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of drawers and the desk. Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by herself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to open the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when Gregor’s father was not there and fetch his mother to help her. As she approached the room, Gregor could hear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent.

格里高尔想见母亲的愿望很快就实现了。出于对父母的体谅，格里高尔白天不想被人看到在窗边，几平方米的地板让他爬来爬去的空间很小，晚上很难安静地躺着，食物很快就让他失去了兴趣。于是，为了自娱自乐，他养成了在墙壁和天花板上爬上爬下的习惯。他尤其喜欢挂在天花板上；这和躺在地板上截然不同；他可以呼吸更自由；他的身体可以轻轻摆动；在那里，他放松下来，几乎是快乐的，说不定他会惊讶地从天花板上掉下来，重重地摔在地板上。但现在，他当然比以前能更好地控制自己的身体，即使摔得那么重，也不会对自己造成任何伤害。姐姐很快就注意到格里高尔新的娱乐方式——毕竟，他爬来爬去的时候，脚上留下了黏合剂的痕迹——于是她下定决心，要尽可能方便格里高尔，把挡路的家具搬走，尤其是五斗橱和书桌。这可不是她自己能做到的；她不敢向父亲求助；自从厨子走后，那个十六岁的小丫头勇敢地继续着，但她肯定不会帮忙，她甚至还要求允许厨房一直锁着，除非有特别重要的事，否则永远不要开门；所以姐姐只好选在格里高尔父亲不在的时候，叫母亲来帮忙。格里高尔听到母亲走近房间，表达着喜悦，但一到门口，她就沉默了。

First, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her mother enter. Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance. Gregor also refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come. “You can come in, he can’t be seen”, said his sister, obviously leading her in by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for herself and ignoring her mother’s warnings that she would strain herself. This lasted a very long time. After labouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the chest where it was, for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the job finished before Gregor’s father got home and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for another thing it wasn’t even sure that taking the furniture away would really be any help to him. She thought just the opposite; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn’t Gregor feel the same way about it, he’d been used to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting Gregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone of her voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her words, she added “and by taking the furniture away, won’t it seem like we’re showing that we’ve given up all hope of improvement and we’re abandoning him to cope for himself? I think it’d be best to leave the room exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again he’ll find everything unchanged and he’ll be able to forget the time in between all the easier”.

当然，首先是他姐姐进来，环顾四周，确认房间里一切安好；然后才让母亲进来。格里高尔匆忙地把床单拉低盖在沙发上，又叠了些褶子，让一切都看起来像是无意间被掀翻的。这次格里高尔也克制住了自己，没有从床单下往外窥探；他放弃了稍后再看母亲的机会，只是庆幸她来了。“你可以进来了，不会有人看到他。”他姐姐说着，显然是牵着她的手领着她进来。那只旧抽屉柜太重了，两个虚弱的女人搬不动，但格里高尔听着她们把它从原处推开。他姐姐总是自己挑最重的活儿，完全不顾母亲的警告，说她会累到自己。这种情况持续了很长时间。费了十五分钟或更长时间才搬好，格里高尔的母亲说最好还是把箱子放在原处。一来，箱子太重了，格里高尔的父亲回家前他们没法搬完，放在房间中央更碍事，二来，搬走家具也不一定能帮上忙。但她的想法恰恰相反；光秃秃的墙壁让她心如刀割；格里高尔怎么会不这么想呢？他早就习惯了房间里摆放的家具，待在那样一个空荡荡的房间里，会让他有种被遗弃的感觉。然后，她轻声细语，几乎是耳语，仿佛不想让格里高尔（她不知道他的下落）听见她的声音，因为她确信他听不懂她的话。她补充道：“把家具搬走，是不是显得我们放弃了一切改善的希望，让他独自面对一切？我觉得最好还是把房间恢复原样，这样格里高尔回来的时候，一切都没有改变，他就能更容易地忘记那段时间。”



Hearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the lack of any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led by the family during these two months, must have made him confused—he could think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his room emptied out. Had he really wanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice furniture he had inherited? That would have let him crawl around unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quickly forget his past when he had still been human. He had come very close to forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for so long, that had shaken him out of it. Nothing should be removed; everything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the furniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage.

听到母亲的这些话，格里高尔意识到，这两个月里，由于缺乏直接的人际交流，加上家里单调乏味的生活，他肯定感到困惑——他想不出其他任何解释，来解释自己为什么真心想把房间清空。他真的想把房间改造成一个洞穴，一个温暖的房间，摆放着继承下来的精美家具吗？那样他就能自由地爬来爬去，但也会让他很快忘记自己还是人类时的过去。他几乎要忘记了，直到母亲那久违的声音把他从记忆中唤醒。什么都不能搬走；所有的东西都必须留下；家具对他身体状况的良好影响是他无法承受的；如果家具让他无法盲目地爬来爬去，那不是损失，而是巨大的好处。



His sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the idea, not without reason, that she was Gregor’s spokesman to his parents about the things that concerned him. This meant that his mother’s advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had thought at first, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch. It was more than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence she had recently acquired, that made her insist; she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to him at all.

不幸的是，他的妹妹不同意；她已经习惯了格里高尔向父母表达关心，向父母倾诉的念头，这并非毫无道理。这意味着，母亲的建议现在足以让她坚持不仅要搬走五斗橱和书桌（她最初的想法），还要搬走除了那张至关重要的沙发之外的所有家具。当然，她坚持这么做的不仅仅是孩子气的任性，也不是因为她最近意外获得的自信；她确实注意到格里高尔需要很大的空间爬来爬去，而这些家具，在任何人看来，对他来说都毫无用处。

Girls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever they can. Perhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregor’s situation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could do even more for him. Grete would probably be the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare walls by himself.

不过，那个年纪的女孩确实对事情充满热情，觉得只要有机会就必须得逞。或许正因如此，格蕾特才会故意把格里高尔的处境描绘得比实际情况更令人震惊，以便能为他做更多。格蕾特大概是唯一一个敢于走进格里高尔独自在光秃秃的墙壁上爬来爬去的房间的人。



So she refused to let her mother dissuade her. Gregor’s mother already looked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped Gregor’s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she had. The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if he had to, but the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about it. He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but, unfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch. His mother was not used to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill, so Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. In his startlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a little. It was enough to attract his mother’s attention.

所以她不听母亲劝阻。格里高尔的母亲在房间里已经显得有些不安，她很快就停下话，用尽全力帮格里高尔的妹妹把五斗橱搬了出来。格里高尔即使不得不搬五斗橱也可以不用，但写字台必须得留下。两个女人刚把发出呻吟声的五斗橱推出房间，格里高尔就从沙发底下探出头来，想看看能不能把它弄好。他本想尽量小心谨慎，但不幸的是，母亲先回来了，而隔壁房间里的格蕾特正搂着五斗橱，独自一人把它左右推拉，当然，它一动不动。母亲不习惯格里高尔的出现，他可能会让她感到恶心，于是格里高尔赶紧退到沙发的另一头。然而，他吓了一跳，没能阻止五斗橱前面的床单微微移动。这足以引起他母亲的注意。

She stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out to Grete.

她一动不动地站着，待了一会儿，然后走回格蕾特身边。



Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was happening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all, but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides.

格里高尔一直试图让自己相信没有发生什么不寻常的事，毕竟只是移动了几件家具而已，但他很快就不得不承认，女人们来来往往，她们互相轻声的叫喊声，家具在地板上的刮擦声，所有这些都让他感觉好像自己受到了来自四面八方的攻击。

With his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to the floor, he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand all of this much longer. They were emptying his room out; taking away everything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk where he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been at infant school—he really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women’s intentions were good. He had nearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to say anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped heavily on the floor.

他头和腿被拽得紧紧地贴着身体，身体紧贴着地板，不得不承认自己再也忍受不了了。她们正在清空他的房间，拿走他所有珍贵的东西；她们已经搬走了装着钢丝锯和其他工具的柜子；现在她们威胁要搬走那张已经磨损得与地板融为一体的写字台。他做商务实习生时，高中时，甚至上幼儿园时，都在这张桌子上写作业——他真的迫不及待地想看看那两个女人是不是好心。他几乎忘了她们在那里，因为她们现在工作时累得说不出话来，他只能听到她们沉重的脚步声。



So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not knowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall—which was already denuded of everything else that had been on it—of the lady dressed in copious fur.

因此，当女人们靠在另一个房间的桌子上喘口气时，他冲了出去，改变了四次方向，不知道应该先保存什么，然后他的注意力突然被墙上的一幅画所吸引——这幅画上已经被剥光了一切——那位穿着华丽皮草的女士。

He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly. This picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by no-one. He turned his head to face the door into the living room so that he could watch the women when they came back.

他急忙走到画像前，贴在玻璃上，画像紧紧地贴着他，让他火热的小腹感到很舒服。至少这幅画现在完全被格里高尔遮住了，肯定不会被人拿走。他转过头，面向客厅的门，这样就能看到女人们回来的情景了。



They had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon; Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her.

她们没有休息太久，很快就回来了；格蕾特用胳膊搂着母亲，几乎是把她抱在怀里。

“What shall we take now, then?”, said Grete and looked around. Her eyes met those of Gregor on the wall. Perhaps only because her mother was there, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice: “Come on, let’s go back in the living room for a while?” Gregor could see what Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down from the wall. Well, she could certainly try it! He sat unyielding on his picture. He would rather jump at Grete’s face.

“那我们现在拿什么呢？”格蕾特说着，环顾四周。她的目光与墙上格里高尔的目光相遇。或许是因为母亲在场，她才保持镇定，低下头，不让自己回头，然后语气急促，声音颤抖地说道：“走吧，我们回客厅待一会儿？”格里高尔看得出格蕾特的心思，她想带母亲去个安全的地方，然后把他从墙边赶下来。好吧，她当然可以试试！他一动不动地坐在画上。他宁愿扑向格蕾特的脸。



But Grete’s words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw screamed: “Oh God, oh God!” Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. “Gregor!”

可是格蕾特的话让母亲着急了，她闪到一旁，看到墙纸花朵衬托着一大片棕色斑点，还没等她反应过来那是格里高尔，就尖叫起来：“哦，天哪，哦，天哪！”她张开双臂，仿佛放弃了一切，瘫倒在沙发上，一动不动。“格里高尔！”

shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too—he could save his picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he startled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut Gregor’s face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother; she slammed the door shut with her foot. So now Gregor was shut out from his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she had to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about, he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table.

“格里高尔！”妹妹怒视着他，挥舞着拳头喊道。这是他变身后她第一次直接和他说这句话。她跑到另一个房间去拿嗅盐，好让昏迷的母亲苏醒过来；格里高尔也想帮忙——他以后可以救活他的画，尽管他紧紧地贴在玻璃上，不得不用力把自己拉起来；然后他也跑到隔壁房间，仿佛可以像以前一样劝告妹妹；但他只能站在她身后，什么也没做；她正在看各种瓶子，转身时被他吓了一跳；一个瓶子掉在地上摔碎了；一根碎片划破了格里高的脸，某种腐蚀性药物溅了他一身；现在，格蕾特不再拖延，抓起所有能抓到的瓶子，跑进屋里去找母亲；她用脚把门砰地关上。现在格里高尔被关在了母亲的门外，而他的母亲可能因为他而濒临死亡；如果他不想把妹妹赶走，他就不能开门，而妹妹又必须和母亲待在一起；他除了等待别无选择；焦虑和自责压得他喘不过气来，他开始四处爬行，爬过所有的东西，墙壁、家具、天花板，最后，由于混乱，整个房间开始在他周围旋转，他跌倒在餐桌中央。



He lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was quiet, maybe that was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door.

他躺在那儿，麻木了一会儿，一动不动。周围一片寂静，或许这是个好兆头。这时，门口传来一个人。

The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete would have to go and answer it. His father had arrived home. “What’s happened?” were his first words; Grete’s appearance must have made everything clear to him. She answered him with subdued voice, and openly pressed her face into his chest: “Mother’s fainted, but she’s better now. Gregor got out.” “Just as I expected”, said his father, “just as I always said, but you women wouldn’t listen, would you.” It was clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father took it to mean that something bad had happened, that he was responsible for some act of violence. That meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible. So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he came in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would go back into his room without delay, that it would not be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would disappear.

女佣当然把自己锁在厨房里了，所以格蕾特得去开门。父亲回家了。“发生什么事了？”这是他开口的第一句话；格蕾特的出现一定让他明白了一切。她低声回答，并坦然地把脸贴在他的胸口：“妈妈晕过去了，现在好多了。格里高尔出来了。”“不出所料，”父亲说，“我一直都这么说，但你们女人就是不听，对吧。”格里高尔很清楚，格蕾特说的还不够，父亲以为发生了什么不好的事情，以为他要为某种暴力行为负责。这意味着格里高尔现在必须设法安抚父亲，因为即使有机会，他也没时间向父亲解释。于是他跑到房间门口，紧紧贴着门，这样当他的父亲从大厅进来时，就能立刻看出格里高尔是好意，会立即回到自己的房间，没必要把他赶回去，只要打开门，他就会消失。



His father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that; “Ah!”, he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both angry and glad at the same time. Gregor drew his head back from the door and lifted it towards his father. He really had not imagined his father the way he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about, he had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the flat the way he had done before. He really ought to have expected things to have changed, but still, still, was that really his father?

然而，他的父亲却没心思去注意这些细微之处。“啊！”他一进来就喊道，听起来既生气又高兴。格里高尔把头从门口缩了回来，抬头看着父亲。他真的没想过父亲现在站在那里的样子；最近，他养成了爬来爬去的新习惯，已经不像以前那样关注公寓里其他地方发生的事情了。他真的应该预料到事情会有所改变，但是，还是，还是，那真的是他的父亲吗？

The same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his business trips, who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings; who was hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would just raise his arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they went for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always labour his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walking slowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully and, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his companions around him. He was standing up straight enough now; dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar of the coat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy eyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp. He took his cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towards Gregor. He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high. Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time with that—he knew full well, right from the first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely strict with him. And so he ran up to his father, stopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved, even slightly. In this way they went round the room several times without anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression of a chase as everything went so slowly. Gregor remained all this time on the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever he did, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for long, as for each step his father took he had to carry out countless movements. He became noticeably short of breath, even in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable. Now, as he lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for running he could hardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too slow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running; he almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although, here, they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and protrusions—then, right beside him, lightly tossed, something flew down and rolled in front of him. It was an apple; then another one immediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was no longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard him. He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. An apple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor’s back and slid off without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately following it, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by changing his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out, all his senses in confusion. The last thing he saw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister was screaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his sister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her to breathe), she ran to his father, her skirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father, her arms around him, uniting herself with him totally—now Gregor lost his ability to see anything—her hands behind his father’s head begging him to spare Gregor’s life.

格里高尔出差回来时，他总是疲惫地躺在床上；晚上格里高尔回来时，他总是穿着睡衣坐在扶手椅上迎接他；他几乎站不起来了，但为了表示高兴，他只会举起双臂；每年星期天或节假日，格里高尔和母亲都会一起出去散步，他紧紧裹着大衣，夹在母亲和格里高尔中间，总是比母亲慢一些，因为母亲们已经为了格里高尔而放慢了脚步；他总是小心翼翼地放下拐杖，要是格里高尔想说什么，总是会停下来，把同伴们叫到身边。现在他站得笔直了，穿着一套漂亮的蓝色制服，上面镶着金色的纽扣，就像银行职员穿的那种；大衣高高的硬领子上面露出了结实的双下巴；浓密的眉毛下，一双锐利的黑眼睛显得神采奕奕，目光炯炯；他一向蓬乱的白发被梳得紧紧地贴着头皮，疼得要命。他拿起那顶可能是从银行借来的、上面绣着金色字母的帽子，把它划出一道弧线，扔到房间另一边的沙发上。他双手插在裤兜里，撩起长长的制服外套下摆，神情坚定地朝格里高尔走去。他自己可能也不知道自己在想什么，但还是把脚抬得高高的。格里高尔被靴子的巨大鞋底惊呆了，但他没有多想——从新生活的第一天起，他就深知父亲对他必须极其严格。于是，他跑到父亲面前，父亲停下脚步，他也跟着停下；父亲稍稍动了一下，他也跟着跑上前去。就这样，他们绕着房间转了几圈，没有发生什么惊天动地的举动，甚至没有留下任何追逐的痕迹，因为一切都进展得非常缓慢。格里高尔一直趴在地板上，主要是因为他担心如果他跑到墙上或天花板上，父亲会觉得他特别恼火。无论他做什么，格里高尔都不得不承认，他肯定无法长时间地这样奔跑，因为父亲每迈出一步，他都要做出无数的动作。他明显感到呼吸困难，即使在他早年，他的肺也不太可靠。现在，他踉踉跄跄地努力使出浑身力气奔跑，却几乎睁不开眼睛；他的思维变得迟钝，除了奔跑，他想不出任何其他自救的方法；他几乎忘记了墙壁的存在，尽管在这里，墙壁隐藏在精心雕琢、布满凹痕和凸起的家具后面——然后，就在他身边，轻轻地被抛了一下，一个东西飞了下来，滚到他面前。那是一个苹果；然后，另一个苹果立刻朝他飞来；格里高尔吓得僵住了；既然父亲决定要对他进行猛烈攻击，他再也跑不动了。他从餐具柜上的碗里掏出水果，口袋里装满了水果，现在，他甚至没来得及仔细瞄准，就把一个苹果扔了出去。这些小小的红苹果在地上滚动，互相撞击，就像装了电动机一样。一个没费多大力气就扔出去的苹果擦过格里高尔的后背，滑落下来，没有造成任何伤害。然而，紧接着，另一个苹果正中格里高尔的后背，卡住了他的后背；格里高尔想挣脱，仿佛换个姿势就能摆脱这突如其来的、难以置信的疼痛；但他感觉自己像被钉在了原地，四肢摊开，浑身麻木。他最后看到的东西是他的房门被拉开了，他的妹妹在尖叫，他的母亲穿着衬衣跑到她面前（因为他的妹妹在昏厥后脱掉了一些衣服以便呼吸更顺畅），她跑向他的父亲，她的裙子解开了，一条接一条地滑落到地上，她踉踉跄跄地被裙子绊倒，她把自己推到他的父亲身边，用手臂搂住他，与他完全融为一体——现在格里高尔失去了看见任何东西的能力——她的手放在父亲的脑后，乞求他饶恕格里高尔的性命。

No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor’s flesh, so it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury. He had suffered it there for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to remind even his father that Gregor, despite his current sad and revolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an enemy. On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any revulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.

没人敢拔掉格里高尔肉里的苹果，所以它留在那里，成为他受伤的明显痕迹。格里高尔已经在那里受了一个多月的伤，情况似乎严重到甚至让他的父亲都意识到，尽管格里高尔现在的样子令人悲伤和厌恶，但他仍然是家人，不能被当作敌人对待。相反，作为家人，我们有责任忍受对他的任何厌恶，耐心等待，仅仅只是耐心等待。



Because of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility—probably permanently. He had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and it took him long, long minutes to crawl across his room—crawling over the ceiling was out of the question—but this deterioration in his condition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening. He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then, lying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the living room, he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table and listen to their conversation—with everyone’s permission, in a way, and thus quite differently from before.

由于受伤，格里高尔几乎丧失了行动能力——很可能是永久性的。他已经像个老病人一样，爬过房间要花很长时间——爬过天花板更是不可能——但他身体状况的恶化完全被（在他看来）每天晚上敞开的客厅门所弥补。他养成了在门打开前一两个小时密切注视门的习惯，然后躺在房间里黑暗的地方，这样客厅里的人就看不到他了，他就能借着餐桌的灯光观察这家人，倾听他们的谈话——在某种程度上，这是得到了所有人的允许，因此与以前截然不同。



They no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of course, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when he was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. All of them were usually very quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, his father would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who had taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be able to get a better position later on. Sometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor’s mother “you’re doing so much sewing again today!”, as if he did not know that he had been dozing—and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin.

当然，他们不再像以前那样热烈地交谈了，格里高尔疲惫不堪，躺在某个小旅馆房间里潮湿的床上时，总会怀念起以前那些愉快的谈话。如今，他们通常都很安静。晚饭后不久，父亲就坐在椅子上睡着了；母亲和妹妹互相劝说要安静；母亲在灯下弯着腰，为一家时装店缝制精美的内衣；妹妹找了一份销售工作，晚上学习速记和法语，以便以后能找到更好的工作。有时，父亲会醒来，对格里高尔的母亲说：“你今天又做这么多针线活儿！”，仿佛他不知道自己刚才一直在打瞌睡似的——然后他又会回去睡觉，母亲和妹妹则会交换一个疲惫的笑容。



With a kind of stubbornness, Gregor’s father refused to take his uniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg Gregor’s father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even here. The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregor’s mother and sister to look after it. Gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful.

格里高尔的父亲固执地拒绝脱下制服，即使在家里也是如此。他的睡衣挂在衣钩上，无人使用。格里高尔的父亲则衣冠楚楚地睡在原地，仿佛随时准备效劳，甚至在这里也期待着听到上司的声音。这套制服本来就不新，但尽管格里高尔的母亲和姐姐费尽心思打理，它还是慢慢地变得破旧不堪。格里高尔常常会整晚盯着这件外套上的污渍，外套上的金纽扣总是擦得锃亮，而穿着它的老人则睡得非常不舒服，但却很安详。



As soon as it struck ten, Gregor’s mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn’t sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work. But since he had been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. Then, however much mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up.

一到十点，格里高尔的母亲就会轻声细语地叫醒父亲，劝他上床睡觉，因为他现在睡不好，如果要在六点起床去上班，就必须好好睡一觉。但自从工作以来，他变得更加固执，总是坚持要在餐桌前待更长时间，即使他经常睡着，这时说服他把椅子换成床就变得比以往任何时候都更加困难。然后，无论母亲和姐姐如何用责备和警告来烦扰他，他都会闭着眼睛慢慢摇头，坚持一刻钟，不肯起床。

Gregor’s mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, Gregor’s sister would leave her work to help her mother, but nothing would have any effect on him. He would just sink deeper into his chair. Only when the two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: “What a life! This is what peace I get in my old age!” And supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself, let the women take him to the door, send them off and carry on by himself while Gregor’s mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him.

格里高尔的母亲会拉拉他的袖子，在他耳边低声说着甜言蜜语，格里高尔的姐姐会放下工作去帮母亲，但这一切都对他毫无作用。他只会更加深陷在椅子里。只有当两个女人把他搂在怀里时，他才会猛地睁开眼睛，一眼一眼地看着她们，说道：“这是什么生活！这就是我晚年所能得到的平静！”在两个女人的搀扶下，他小心翼翼地站起身，仿佛自己扛着最重的负担，让两个女人把他送到门口，送她们离开，然后自己继续前行。格里高尔的母亲会扔下针，妹妹会扔下笔，让她们去追赶他的父亲，继续帮助他。



Who, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The household budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else was looked after by Gregor’s mother on top of the large amount of sewing work she did. Gregor even learned, listening to the evening conversation about what price they had hoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address. He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back from their decision to move was much more to do with their total despair, and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to. They carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people, Gregor’s father brought bank employees their breakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but they just did not have the strength to do any more. And the injury in Gregor’s back began to hurt as much as when it was new. After they had come back from taking his father to bed Gregor’s mother and sister would now leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother would point to Gregor’s room and say “Close that door, Grete”, and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit in the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table.

在这个疲惫不堪、劳累过度的家庭里，谁会有时间照顾格里高尔，除非绝对必要？家里的预算越来越少，女佣也被解雇了；一个身材魁梧、骨架粗壮、白发飘飘的清洁女工每天早晚都来做最繁重的活儿；格里高尔的母亲除了做大量的缝纫活儿外，其他一切都由她来打理。格里高尔甚至在晚上听到他们谈论他们希望的售价时，得知家里的几件珠宝被卖掉了，尽管母亲和姐姐都很喜欢在各种聚会和庆典上佩戴它们。但最让人抱怨的是，虽然这套公寓对他们目前的情况来说太大了，但他们搬不出去，根本无法把格里高尔搬到新住处。不过，他很清楚，搬家除了出于对他的考虑之外，还有其他原因，如果用一个合适的箱子，只要有几个透气孔，就能很容易地把他运走；阻碍这家人决定搬家的主要原因，更多是因为他们彻底的绝望，以及他们认为自己遭遇了一场他们认识或亲属从未经历过的不幸。他们做了穷人应尽的一切义务：格里高尔的父亲给银行职员送早餐，母亲牺牲自己为陌生人洗衣服，妹妹在顾客的吩咐下在办公桌后跑来跑去，但她们再也无力再做了。格里高尔背上的伤又开始像刚受伤时一样疼痛。格里高尔的母亲和妹妹送父亲上床睡觉回来后，会放下手中的工作，脸贴着脸紧紧地坐在一起；母亲会指着格里高尔的房间说：“关上那扇门，格蕾特！”然后，等格里高尔再次回到黑暗中，她们会坐在隔壁房间，泪流满面，或者只是干坐着，干巴巴地盯着桌子。



Gregor hardly slept at all, either night or day. Sometimes he would think of taking over the family’s affairs, just like before, the next time the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow,—all of them appeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others he had forgotten, but instead of helping him and his family they were all of them inaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared. Other times he was not at all in the mood to look after his family, he was filled with simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown, and although he could think of nothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he could get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to, even if he was not hungry. Gregor’s sister no longer thought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it away again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or—more often than not—had been left totally untouched. She still cleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any quicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there were little balls of dust and filth. At first, Gregor went into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it. At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood—cleaning up Gregor’s room was for her and her alone.

格里高尔几乎白天不睡，夜里也不睡。有时，他会像以前一样，等下次门开的时候，再去接手家里的事务；他早已忘记了老板和主管，但他们又会浮现在他的脑海里：推销员、学徒、那个愚蠢的茶童、两三个其他行业的朋友、一个外省旅馆的女服务员、一个出现又消失的温馨回忆、一个帽子店的收银员（他曾经认真对待过她，但处理得太慢了）——所有这些人都出现在他面前，和陌生人以及其他他已经忘记的人混在一起，但他们非但没有帮助他和他的家人，反而变得难以接近，他很高兴他们消失了。其他时候，他根本没有心情照顾家人，只是对别人对他的漠不关心感到愤怒，虽然他想不出自己想要什么，但他还是盘算着怎么才能进入食品储藏室，在那里他可以拿走所有他有权得到的东西，即使他并不饿。格里高尔的姐姐不再想着如何取悦他，而是每天早上和中午匆匆忙忙地用脚把食物或其他东西塞进他的房间，然后匆匆忙忙地出去工作，晚上再用扫帚清扫一遍，根本不在乎食物是被吃掉的，还是——更多的时候——完全没动过。她晚上仍然会打扫房间，但现在她的速度快得不能再快了。墙上留下了污渍，到处都是小团的灰尘和污渍。起初，格里高尔在姐姐来的时候，为了责备她，就去了这种最糟糕的地方之一，但他可以在那里待上几个星期，而姐姐什么也不做；姐姐和格里高尔一样看得清那些污垢，但她只是决定让他自己去做。与此同时，她变得敏感起来，这对她来说很新鲜，家里的每个人都能理解——打扫格里高尔的房间是她一个人的事。

Gregor’s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do it—although that much dampness also made Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But his mother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change in Gregor’s room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living room where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she broke into convulsive tears. Her father, of course, was startled out of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless; then they, too, became agitated; Gregor’s father, standing to the right of his mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor’s room to his sister; from her left, Gregor’s sister screamed at her that she was never to clean Gregor’s room again; while his mother tried to draw his father, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his sister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists; and Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save him the sight of this and all its noise.

格里高尔的母亲曾经彻底打扫过他的房间，用了好几桶水才干完——尽管格里高尔因为太潮湿而生病，躺在沙发上，痛苦不堪，一动不动。但他母亲的所作所为受到了更大的惩罚，因为妹妹晚上刚回家，就注意到格里高尔房间的变化，愤愤不平地跑回客厅，尽管母亲举起双手恳求，她还是放声大哭。她父亲当然从椅子上跳了起来，父母亲惊讶而无助地看着这一切；然后他们也变得焦躁不安；格里高尔的父亲站在母亲的右边，责怪她不把打扫格里高尔房间的事留给妹妹；格里高尔的妹妹站在母亲的左边，对她尖叫，让她再也不许打扫格里高尔的房间；而格里高尔的母亲则试图把怒不可遏的父亲拉进卧室；他的妹妹泪流满面，浑身发抖，用小拳头捶打着桌子；格里高尔愤怒地嘶嘶叫着，说没有人想到关上门，让他不要看到这一幕和随之而来的噪音。



Gregor’s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but even so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place. Gregor, on the other hand, ought not to be neglected. Now, though, the charwoman was here. This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in her long life, wasn’t really repelled by Gregor. Just by chance one day, rather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to Gregor’s room and found herself face to face with him. He was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in front of her. From then on she never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him. At first she would call to him as she did so with words that she probably considered friendly, such as “come on then, you old dung-beetle!”, or “look at the old dung-beetle there!”

格里高尔的姐姐外出工作累得筋疲力尽，像以前那样照顾格里高尔更是雪上加霜，但即便如此，格里高尔的母亲也绝对不应该取代她。格里高尔则更不应该被忽视。不过，现在，清洁女工来了。这位年迈的寡妇骨骼强健，足以承受她漫长人生中最艰难的考验，她对格里高尔并没有真正的排斥。有一天，她偶然打开了格里高尔的房门，与其说是出于好奇，不如说是出于某种意外，结果发现自己正与格里高尔面对面。格里高尔大吃一惊，虽然没有人追他，但他却开始四处乱窜，而她则双手交叉，惊呆地站在那里。从那以后，她每天傍晚和清晨都会轻轻打开房门，匆匆地看他一眼。一开始，她会一边叫他，一边用她认为很友好的话语，比如“快来吧，老蜣螂！”或者“看看那边的老蜣螂！”

Gregor never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just remained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been opened. If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt like it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the windowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to speak to him in that way once again. Gregor was so resentful of it that he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it was like a kind of attack. Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth open, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregor’s back. “Aren’t you coming any closer, then?”, she asked when Gregor turned round again, and she calmly put the chair back in the corner.

格里高尔对她这样说话毫无反应，只是一动不动地待在原地，仿佛门从未被打开过。要是他们告诉这个女佣每天都打扫他的房间，而不是让她无缘无故地随时打扰他就好了！一天清晨，一阵大雨敲打着窗玻璃，或许预示着春天即将来临，她又开始这样跟他说话。格里高尔对此非常反感，开始向她靠近。他行动迟缓，体弱多病，但这就像是一种攻击。女佣非但没有害怕，反而从门口搬起一把椅子，张着嘴站在那里，显然打算不把手里的椅子砸到格里高尔的背上就不闭嘴。“你不靠近点吗？”格里高尔再次转过身时，她问道，然后平静地把椅子放回角落。



Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating. Only if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again. At first he thought it was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes made there. They had got into the habit of putting things into this room that they had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest gentlemen—all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door one day—were painfully insistent on things’ being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate, especially if it was dirty. They had moreover brought most of their own furnishings and equipment with them. For this reason, many things had become superfluous which, although they could not be sold, the family did not wish to discard. All these things found their way into Gregor’s room. The dustbins from the kitchen found their way in there too. The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she couldn’t use for the time being she would just chuck in there. He, fortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else. At first he moved it because, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was forced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired to death, and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards.

格里高尔几乎完全不吃东西了。只有碰巧身边有为他准备的食物时，他才会把食物放进嘴里玩，放上几个小时，然后，通常情况下，又会吐出来。起初，他以为是因为房间太乱才不吃东西，但很快就习惯了房间的变化。他们习惯把其他地方放不下的东西都堆在这个房间里，现在这类东西越来越多了，因为公寓里的一个房间租给了三位先生。这三位先生都留着大胡子，格里高尔有一天透过门缝往里看时才知道这一点。他们非常坚持要把东西收拾得干干净净，这不仅指他们自己的房间，而且既然他们在这家公寓里租了个房间，那么整个公寓，尤其是厨房，也都要收拾。他们无法容忍不必要的杂乱，尤其是脏乱不堪的杂物。此外，他们还带来了大部分自带的家具和用具。因此，很多东西都变得多余，虽然卖不出去，但家人也不想丢弃。这些东西都进了格里高尔的房间。厨房里的垃圾桶也进了。清洁女工总是很匆忙，任何她暂时用不上的东西都会被扔进去。幸运的是，格里高尔通常只看到物品和拿着它的那只手。清洁女工很可能打算等有时间和机会的时候再把东西拿出来，或者一次性全部扔掉，但实际上，除非格里高尔自己翻找垃圾，把它们搬到别的地方，否则它们就会被扔到原地。起初，他搬动垃圾是因为没有其他空余空间可以爬来爬去，他不得不这么做，但后来他开始喜欢搬动垃圾，尽管搬来搬去让他感到悲伤和疲惫，之后他会好几个小时都一动不动。



The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But Gregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often failed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner. One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on. They sat up at the table where, formerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they unfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks. Gregor’s mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. The food was steaming, and filled the room with its smell. The gentlemen bent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish whether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor’s mother and sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and smiled.

租住这间房间的先生们有时会在家里的客厅里吃晚饭，因为客厅是大家共用的，所以这间房间的门晚上经常关着。但格里高尔很容易就放弃了开着门，毕竟他经常在门开着的时候不去用，结果就在房间里最黑暗的角落里偷偷地躺着，家人都没注意到。不过有一次，女佣把客厅的门留了一条缝，所以晚上租住这间房间的先生们进来，打开灯的时候，门还是开着的。他们在格里高尔以前和父母一起吃饭的那张桌子旁坐了起来，打开餐巾，拿起刀叉。格里高尔的母亲立刻端着一盘肉出现在门口，紧接着，格里高尔的妹妹端着一盘堆满土豆的菜也来了。食物热气腾腾，香味弥漫了整个房间。两位先生俯身看着面前的菜肴，仿佛想在吃之前先尝尝味道。中间那位先生，对另外两位先生来说似乎是权威，果然在盘子里切下了一块肉，显然是想看看肉是否煮熟了，还是应该送回厨房。他很满意，格里高尔的母亲和妹妹一直焦急地看着，这时也松了一口气，露出了笑容。



The family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Gregor’s father came into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards. Then, once they were alone, they ate in near perfect silence. It seemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. “I’d like to eat something”, said Gregor anxiously, “but not anything like they’re eating. They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!”

一家人自己在厨房吃饭。不过，格里高尔的父亲在进厨房之前，还是先进了客厅，戴着帽子鞠了一躬，然后绕着桌子走了一圈。两位先生齐声站着，对着胡子嘟囔了几句。等到只剩下他们两人时，他们几乎一声不吭地吃了起来。格里高尔觉得很奇怪，他们吃东西时发出的各种咀嚼声竟然还能听得清清楚楚，仿佛他们想告诉格里高尔，吃饭需要牙齿，而没有牙齿的下巴，无论多么可爱，也做不了任何事。“我想吃点东西，”格里高尔焦急地说，“但不想吃他们吃的东西。他们自己会吃东西。而我，却要死了！”



Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the violin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the others, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and smoking. When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood pressed against each other. Someone must have heard them in the kitchen, as Gregor’s father called out: “Is the playing perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away.” “On the contrary”, said the middle gentleman, “would the young lady not like to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much more cosy and comfortable?” “Oh yes, we’d love to”, called back Gregor’s father as if he had been the violin player himself. The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. Gregor’s father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister with the violin. She calmly prepared everything for her to begin playing; his parents, who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his father leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat—leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it—out of the way in a corner.

格里高尔一直记不起自己听到过小提琴演奏，但今晚厨房里开始传来了小提琴声。三位先生已经吃完饭，中间的那位拿出一份报纸，每人递给其他人一页，现在他们正倚在椅子上一边看报纸一边抽烟。小提琴声响起时，他们立刻就听得清清楚楚，站起身，踮着脚尖走到走廊门口，紧紧地贴在一起。厨房里肯定有人听到了，格里高尔的父亲喊道：“两位先生是不是听得不舒服？我们可以马上停止演奏。” “恰恰相反，”中间的那位先生说，“这位年轻的女士难道不想进来，在我们这间房间里为我们演奏吗？毕竟，这里更舒适惬意。” “哦，当然，我们很乐意。”格里高尔的父亲回应道，仿佛他自己就是小提琴手。两位先生回到房间里，等待着。格里高尔的父亲很快就拿着乐谱架出现了，母亲拿着乐谱，妹妹拿着小提琴。她平静地做好一切准备，准备开始演奏；格里高尔的父母从未租过房间，因此对三位先生显得格外客气，甚至不敢坐在自己的椅子上；父亲倚着门，右手插在制服外套的两颗纽扣之间；而母亲则被一位先生请了座位，她坐了下来，把椅子放在了这位先生碰巧摆放的位置——一个不显眼的角落里。



His sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one on each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing, Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in the living room. Before, he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless about the others. What’s more, there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest movement; he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; he was much too indifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used to do several times a day. And despite this condition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living room.

妹妹开始弹琴了；爸爸妈妈一人站在一旁，密切关注着妹妹手上的动作。格里高尔被琴声吸引，大胆地向前走了几步，已经把头探进了客厅。以前，他一直以自己体贴入微而自豪，但现在他几乎想不到自己竟然变得如此不顾他人。更何况，现在他更需要躲起来了，因为他房间里到处都是灰尘，只要稍微一动，灰尘就会飞起来；他的背上和侧面沾满了线头、头发和食物残渣；他现在对一切都漠不关心，不像以前那样每天躺着用地毯擦身了。尽管如此，他还是毫不害羞地向前挪了挪，走到了客厅一尘不染的地板上。



No-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the violin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor’s sister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume, and they stayed by the window while Gregor’s father observed them anxiously. It really now seemed very obvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed. It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. Yet Gregor’s sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one side, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression. Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came.

然而，没有人注意到他。一家人正全神贯注地听着小提琴演奏；起初，三位先生把手插在口袋里，走到乐谱架后面太近，根本没注意到正在演奏的音符，他们肯定打扰了格里高尔的妹妹。但很快，他们就与家人形成了鲜明对比，低着头退回窗边，用一半的音量互相交谈。格里高尔的父亲焦急地注视着他们，他们就待在窗边。现在看来，他们原本期待听到一段优美或有趣的小提琴演奏，但却失望了，他们已经听够了整场演奏，只是出于礼貌才允许自己的宁静被打扰。尤其令人不安的是，他们每个人都把香烟的烟雾从嘴里和鼻子里向上喷出来。然而，格里高尔的妹妹演奏得如此优美。她侧着脸，带着谨慎而忧郁的表情，随着乐谱的旋律演奏。格里高尔向前爬了一点，把头贴近地面，以便有机会与她对视。

Was he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been yearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He never wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about it last Christmas—had Christmas really come and gone already?—if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to work, she had kept free without any necklace or collar.

如果音乐能如此迷惑他，那他还算野兽吗？他仿佛被指引着通往他一直渴望的未知滋养之路。他决心走到妹妹面前，拉扯她的裙子，示意她可以带着小提琴进他的房间，因为没有人像他一样欣赏她在这里演奏。他永远不想让她离开他的房间，至少在他活着的时候不想；他那令人震惊的外表，至少这一次应该能帮上忙；他想同时出现在房间的每一扇门前，对袭击者发出嘘声和吐口水；但他的妹妹不应该被迫和他待在一起，而是应该自愿留下；她会坐在他身旁的沙发上，侧耳倾听，听他讲述他一直想送她去音乐学院的故事，他会告诉她，如果不是这场不幸的遭遇，他去年圣诞节——如果圣诞节真的已经过去了——就会把这件事告诉所有人，并且不会让任何人劝阻他。听到这些，他的妹妹会激动得泪流满面，格里高尔会爬到她的肩膀上，亲吻她的脖子，自从她出去工作以来，她的脖子上一直空着，没有戴项链或项圈。



“Mr. Samsa!”, shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor’s father, pointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor as he slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor. His father seemed to think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his body. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was his father’s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without knowing it. They asked Gregor’s father for explanations, raised their arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor’s sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the instrument on her mother’s lap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure from her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.

“萨姆沙先生！”中间的那位绅士朝格里高尔的父亲喊道，他二话不说，用食指指着缓缓走上前来的格里高尔。小提琴声戛然而止，三位绅士中间的那位先是对着他的两位朋友笑了笑，摇了摇头，然后又回头看着格里高尔。格里高尔的父亲似乎认为，在赶走格里高尔之前，先安抚好三位绅士更为重要，尽管他们一点也不生气，而且似乎觉得格里高尔比刚才的小提琴演奏更有趣。他张开双臂冲上前去，试图把他们赶回房间，同时用身体挡住他们看格里高尔的视线。现在他们确实有点恼火了，也不知道是父亲的行为惹恼了他们，还是他们逐渐意识到，隔壁竟然有个像格里高尔一样的邻居，而他们对此浑然不觉。他们向格里高尔的父亲寻求解释，像他一样举起双臂，兴奋地拉了拉胡子，然后缓缓地走回房间。与此同时，格里高尔的妹妹克服了演奏突然被打断后陷入的绝望。她放下双手，让小提琴和琴弓无力地垂了一会儿，但她继续看着乐谱，仿佛仍在演奏。但随后，她突然恢复了镇定，把乐器放在母亲的腿上，而母亲仍然坐在原地，艰难地喘着气，跑进了隔壁的房间。在父亲的催促下，三位先生正更快地朝那个房间走去。

Under his sister’s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room. Gregor’s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and pressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought Gregor’s father to a halt. “I declare here and now”, he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor’s mother and sister to gain their attention too, “that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family”—here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor—“I give immediate notice on my room. For the days that I have been living here I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.” He was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And indeed, his two friends joined in with the words: “And we also give immediate notice.” With that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door.

在姐姐熟练的手下，枕头和床罩飞快地被摆放整齐，三位先生还没来得及进屋，她就已经铺好了床，溜了出去。格里高尔的父亲似乎全神贯注于眼前的景象，忘记了对房客应有的尊重。他催促着他们，逼着他们，直到走到房门口，三位先生中间的一位像雷鸣般大喊，跺着脚，格里高尔的父亲才停了下来。 “我在此声明，”他举起手，瞥了一眼格里高尔的母亲和妹妹，想引起她们的注意，“鉴于这套公寓和我们家令人厌恶的状况，”——说到这里，他迅速但果断地看了一眼地板——“我立即通知你我的房间。我住在这里的日子里，当然不会付任何钱，相反，我会考虑是否向你索赔。相信我，要提出索赔理由很容易。”他沉默不语，目光直视前方，仿佛在等待什么。果然，他的两个朋友也附和道：“我们也立即通知你。”说完，他抓住门把手，砰地关上了门。



Gregor’s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his hands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him. His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to move. He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he waited. He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on his mother’s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor.

格里高尔的父亲踉踉跄跄地回到座位上，摸索着走到座位边，一屁股坐了进去；他看起来像是要像往常一样舒展身体，准备睡个午觉，但从他那不受控制地不停点头的样子来看，他根本没睡着。格里高尔一直躺在三位先生第一次看到他的地方。计划失败的失望，或许也因为他饿得虚弱无力，让他一动不动。他确信每个人都会随时攻击他，所以他等待着。甚至当他母亲腿上那把小提琴从她颤抖的指尖滑落，重重地摔在地板上时，他也没有被惊醒。



“Father, Mother”, said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as introduction, “we can’t carry on like this. Maybe you can’t see it, but I can. I don’t want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is: we have to try and get rid of it. We’ve done all that’s humanly possible to look after it and be patient, I don’t think anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong.”

“爸爸，妈妈，”他的妹妹用手敲着桌子，算是开场白，“我们不能再这样下去了。也许你们没注意到，但我注意到了。我不想叫这个怪物我的兄弟，我只能说：我们必须设法摆脱它。我们已经尽了一切人力去照顾它，保持耐心，我想没有人会指责我们做错了什么。”



“She’s absolutely right”, said Gregor’s father to himself. His mother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes.

“她说得完全正确。”格里高尔的父亲自言自语道。母亲还没来得及喘口气，就开始闷闷地咳嗽，手伸到身前，眼神里满是疯狂。



Gregor’s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead.

格里高尔的姐姐冲到他母亲身边，把手放在她的额头上。

Her words seemed to give Gregor’s father some more definite ideas. He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile.

她的话似乎让格里高尔的父亲有了更明确的想法。他端正地坐了起来，把玩着三位先生饭后留下的盘子之间的制服帽，偶尔低头看看一动不动地躺着的格里高尔。



“We have to try and get rid of it”, said Gregor’s sister, now speaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to listen, “it’ll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming. We can’t all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured like this, we can’t endure it. I can’t endure it any more.” And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements.

“我们得想办法摆脱它，”格里高尔的姐姐说道，她现在只对父亲说话，母亲咳嗽得根本没听见，“这会害死你们俩的，我能预见。我们不能都拼命工作，然后回家还要受这种折磨，我们受不了了。我再也受不了了。”她泪流满面，眼泪顺着母亲的脸颊流了下来，母亲机械地用手擦去眼泪。



“My child”, said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding, “what are we to do?”

“我的孩子”，她的父亲带着同情和明显的理解说道，“我们该怎么办？”



His sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness and tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainty.

他的姐姐只是耸耸肩膀，表示她已经陷入无助和泪水中，不再有先前的确定感。



“If he could just understand us”, said his father almost as a question; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that of that there was no question.

“如果他能理解我们的话”，他的父亲几乎以疑问的方式说道；他的妹妹含着泪水用力地挥了挥手，表示毫无疑问。



“If he could just understand us”, repeated Gregor’s father, closing his eyes in acceptance of his sister’s certainty that that was quite impossible, “then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement with him. But as it is …”

“如果他能理解我们的话，”格里高尔的父亲重复道，闭上眼睛，接受了妹妹的肯定，认为这根本不可能，“那么也许我们可以和他达成某种协议。但事实上……”



“It’s got to go”, shouted his sister, “that’s the only way, Father.

“必须把它拿走”，他的妹妹喊道，“这是唯一的办法，爸爸。

You’ve got to get rid of the idea that that’s Gregor. We’ve only harmed ourselves by believing it for so long. How can that be Gregor? If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it’s not possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of his own free will. We wouldn’t have a brother any more, then, but we could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect. As it is this animal is persecuting us, it’s driven out our tenants, it obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on the streets. Father, look, just look”, she suddenly screamed, “he’s starting again!” In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor’s comprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay anywhere near Gregor. She rushed over to behind her father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his hands in front of Gregor’s sister as if to protect her.

你得打消那个念头，那就是格里高尔。我们这么久以来一直这么想，只会害了自己。那怎么会是格里高尔？如果是格里高尔，他早就明白人不可能和那样的动物生活在一起，然后就会自愿离开。那样的话，我们虽然没有兄弟了，但我们可以继续生活，怀着敬意缅怀他。可现在，这畜生正在迫害我们，赶走了我们的房客，显然是想霸占整个公寓，逼我们露宿街头。爸爸，你看，你看，”她突然尖叫起来，“他又开始了！”格里高尔完全无法理解妹妹的惊慌，她甚至抛下了母亲，用力地从椅子上站了起来，仿佛宁愿牺牲自己的母亲也不愿靠近格里高尔。她冲到父亲身后，父亲也因为她而激动起来，站起身来，在格里高尔妹妹面前半举着双手，仿佛要保护她。



But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his sister. All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against the floor. He stopped and looked round. They seemed to have realised his good intention and had only been alarmed briefly. Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence.

但格里高尔无意吓唬任何人，尤其是他的妹妹。他只是开始转身，好回房间，但这本身就令人吃惊，因为他饱受疼痛折磨，转身需要很大的力气，而且他得用头来支撑，不停地抬起头，又撞向地板。他停下来，环顾四周。他们似乎意识到了他的好意，只是短暂地惊慌了一下。现在，他们都闷闷不乐地默默看着他。

His mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his father with her arms around his neck.

他的母亲躺在椅子上，双腿伸直并挤在一起，疲惫不堪，几乎闭上了眼睛；他的姐姐坐在父亲旁边，搂着他的脖子。



“Maybe now they’ll let me turn round”, thought Gregor and went back to work. He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had sometimes to stop and take a rest. No-one was making him rush any more, everything was left up to him. As soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead. He was amazed at the great distance that separated him from his room, and could not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little while before and almost without noticing it. He concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood up. With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen completely asleep.

“也许现在他们会让我转身了。”格里高尔心想，又继续干活了。他费力地喘着粗气，不时不得不停下来休息。没人再催他了，一切都由他自己决定。转完身后，他便径直向前走去。他惊讶地发现自己和房间之间竟然隔着这么远的距离，他不明白自己刚才在虚弱的状态下，是如何几乎毫无察觉地爬过这段距离的。他专心致志地尽可能快地爬行，几乎没有注意到家人没有说一句话，也没有哭喊声来分散他的注意力。直到走到门口，他才回过头。他没有完全转过头，因为他感觉脖子僵硬了，但这足以让他看到身后什么也没变，只有妹妹站了起来。他最后一眼看到母亲已经完全睡着了。



He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut, bolted and locked. The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that his little legs collapsed under him. It was his sister who had been in so much of a rush. She had been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents “At last!”.

他刚进房间，门就被匆匆关上，插上门闩，锁上了。格里高尔身后突然响起，吓得他小腿一软。原来是他妹妹跑得太急了。她一直站在那里等着，轻轻地向前一跃，格里高尔根本没听到她过来，她转动钥匙开锁，大声对父母说：“终于来了！”



“What now, then?”, Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the darkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all. This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural. He also felt relatively comfortable. It is true that his entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether. He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust. He thought back of his family with emotion and love. If it was possible, he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his sister. He remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning. He watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too. Then, without his willing it, his head sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.

“现在怎么办？”格里高尔一边在黑暗中环顾四周，一边自问。很快，他发现自己再也动弹不得了。这对他来说并不意外，更确切地说，在那之前，能够用那双细长的腿走动似乎很不自然。他感觉也相对舒服。的确，他浑身酸痛，但疼痛似乎正在慢慢减弱，最终会完全消失。他几乎感觉不到背上腐烂的苹果，也感觉不到周围被白色灰尘覆盖的发炎区域。他满怀深情地思念着家人。如果可以的话，他觉得自己必须比姐姐更强烈地离开。他一直沉浸在这种空虚而平静的沉思中，直到听到钟楼敲响凌晨三点。他看着窗外的天色也渐渐亮了起来。然后，他不由自主地完全垂下了头，最后一口气从鼻孔里无力地流出。



When the cleaner came in early in the morning—they’d often asked her not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry she still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she’d arrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace—she made her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing special. She thought he was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she attributed all possible understanding to him. She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway. When she had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention. She soon realised what had really happened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms: “Come and ’ave a look at this, it’s dead, just lying there, stone dead!”

清洁工一大早就来了——他们经常让她别一直摔门，但她力气又大，又急，还是摔门而来，好让公寓里的每个人都知道她什么时候来的，从此以后就没法安心睡觉了——她像往常一样，匆匆看了格里高尔一眼，起初没发现什么异常。她以为格里高尔故意一动不动地躺在那儿，装作一副殉道者的样子；她觉得格里高尔似乎理解她的意思。她手里正好拿着长扫帚，就想从门口用它挠格里高尔痒痒。没挠着痒痒，她就故意弄得格里高尔很烦，轻轻戳了戳他，直到她发现自己可以毫不费力地把他推倒在地，才开始留意。她很快就意识到发生了什么事，睁大眼睛，吹了声口哨，但没有浪费时间，猛地打开卧室的门，对着黑暗的卧室大声喊道：“快来看看，它死了，就躺在那里，一动不动！”



Mr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they could grasp what she was saying. But then, each from his own side, they hurried out of bed. Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders, Mrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is how they went into Gregor’s room. On the way they opened the door to the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this. “Dead?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for herself and could have known it even without checking. “That’s what I said”, replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor’s body another shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor.

萨姆沙夫妇在婚床上笔直地坐着，费力地从清洁工的惊吓中缓过来，才明白清洁工在说什么。然后，他们各自匆匆起床。萨姆沙先生把毯子披在肩上，萨姆沙太太则穿着睡衣走了出来；就这样，他们走进了格里高尔的房间。半路上，他们打开了客厅的门，自从三位先生搬进来后，格蕾特就一直睡在那里；她衣冠楚楚，仿佛从未睡过，她苍白的脸色似乎也证实了这一点。“死了？”萨姆沙太太疑惑地看着清洁工，尽管她自己可以确认，甚至不用确认也能知道。“我就是这么说的，”清洁工回答道，为了证明这一点，她用扫帚又猛地推了一下格里高尔的尸体，把它推倒在地板上。

Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not complete it. “Now then”, said Mr. Samsa, “let’s give thanks to God for that”. He crossed himself, and the three women followed his example. Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: “Just look how thin he was. He didn’t eat anything for so long. The food came out again just the same as when it went in”. Gregor’s body was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make them look away.

萨姆沙太太做了个动作，好像想把扫帚收起来，但没能收住。“好了，”萨姆沙先生说，“让我们为此感谢上帝吧。”他划了个十字，三个女人也跟着划了个十字。格蕾特目不转睛地盯着尸体，说道：“你看他瘦得多瘦。他这么久没吃东西了。食物吐出来的时候和吃进去的时候一模一样。”格里高尔的尸体确实已经完全干瘪扁平了，他们之前都没看到，但现在他不再用小腿支撑身体，也没有做出任何让他们移开视线的动作。



“Grete, come with us in here for a little while”, said Mrs. Samsa with a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of March, after all.

“格蕾特，跟我们进去一会儿吧。”萨姆沙太太苦笑着说。格蕾特跟着父母走进卧室，却不忘回头看了一眼尸体。清洁工关上门，把窗户打开。虽然时间还早，但新鲜的空气中却夹杂着一丝暖意。毕竟，已经是三月底了。



The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. “Where is our breakfast?”, the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably.

三位先生走出房间，惊讶地四处寻找他们的早餐；他们竟然把早餐忘了。“我们的早餐呢？”中间的那位先生恼怒地问清洁工。

She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor’s room. They did so, and stood around Gregor’s corpse with their hands in the pockets of their well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room.

她只是把手指放在嘴唇上，快速无声地向那几个人示意，让他们进格里高尔的房间。他们照做了，然后站在格里高尔的尸体周围，双手插在破旧的外套口袋里。房间里现在很亮了。



Then the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her face against her father’s arm.

这时，卧室的门开了，萨姆沙先生穿着制服出现了，一只胳膊搂着妻子，另一只胳膊搂着女儿。他们都哭了一会儿；格蕾特不时把脸贴在父亲的胳膊上。



“Leave my home. Now!”, said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and without letting the women from him. “What do you mean?”, asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly. The other two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in their favour. “I mean just what I said”, answered Mr.

“离开我的家。现在就走！”萨姆沙先生指着门说道，没有让女士们离开。“你什么意思？”三位男士中间的一位略显尴尬地问道，然后甜甜地笑了笑。另外两位男士把手背在身后，不停地搓着，兴高采烈地期待着一场势均力敌的争吵，而这场争吵最终只会对他们有利。“我说的就是这个意思，”萨姆沙先生回答道。

Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards the man. At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new positions. “Alright, we’ll go then”, he said, and looked up at Mr.

萨姆沙和他的两个同伴径直朝那个男人走去。起初，他一动不动地站在那里，看着地面，仿佛脑子里的东西正在重新排列成新的位置。“好吧，我们走吧。”他说着，抬头看着先生。

Samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision. Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times. At that, and without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the front hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said. Now they jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr.

萨姆沙仿佛突然感到谦卑，再次向萨姆沙先生请求许可。萨姆沙先生只是睁大了眼睛，朝他点了几次头。话音刚落，那人便大步走进了前厅；他的两个朋友刚才已经停止搓手，一直在听着他们说话。现在，他们也跳了起来，追赶着他们的朋友，仿佛突然害怕萨姆沙先生……

Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the connection with their leader. Once there, all three took their hats from the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a word and left the premises. Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men’s intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa family lost interest in them; when a butcher’s boy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer than they were, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat.

萨姆沙或许会先他们走进走廊，断绝与首领的联系。到了那里，三人从帽架上取下帽子，从棍棒架上取下手杖，默默地鞠躬行礼，离开了房间。萨姆沙先生和两个女人跟着他们走到楼梯平台；但他们没有理由怀疑这几个男人的意图，当他们探身越过楼梯平台时，看到三位先生缓慢而坚定地走下层层楼梯。他们每拐过一层楼的拐角，就会消失不见，过一会儿又会出现；他们走得越远，萨姆沙一家就越对他们失去兴趣；当一个屠夫的伙计，骄傲地把托盘放在头上，从他们身边走过，走到比他们更近的地方时，萨姆沙先生和两个女人才离开楼梯平台，仿佛松了一口气，回到了公寓里。



They decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation and to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but they were in serious need of it. So they sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal, Mr. Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her contractor and Grete to her principal. The cleaner came in while they were writing to tell them she was going, she’d finished her work for that morning. The three of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. “Well?”, asked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa all the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all directions. “What is it you want then?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the most respect for. “Yes”, she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, “well then, that thing in there, you needn’t worry about how you’re going to get rid of it. That’s all been sorted out.” Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were writing; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite clear that she was not to. So, as she was prevented from telling them all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved, called out “Cheerio then, everyone”, turned round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.

他们决定，利用这一天最好的方式就是放松一下，散散步；他们不仅应该从工作中抽身，而且非常需要休息。于是，他们坐在桌旁，写了三封请假信：萨姆沙先生写给他的雇主，萨姆沙太太写给她的承包商，格蕾特写给她的委托人。清洁工在他们写信的时候进来告诉他们她要走了，她已经完成了上午的工作。起初，他们三个人只是点点头，没有抬头，只是看到清洁工似乎仍然不想离开，他们才恼怒地抬起头。“怎么样？”萨姆沙先生问道。清洁女工站在门口，脸上带着微笑，仿佛有什么天大的好消息要汇报，但只有被明确要求时才会说。她帽子上那根几乎垂直的小鸵鸟毛，在她为萨姆沙先生工作期间一直让萨姆沙先生心烦意乱，此刻正轻轻地向四周摇曳。 “那您有什么事吗？”清洁工最尊敬的萨姆莎太太问道。“是的，”她回答道，然后友好地笑了起来，让她一时语塞，“好吧，那里面的东西，您不用担心怎么处理掉。一切都安排好了。”萨姆莎太太和格蕾特弯下腰，看着信，似乎想继续写下去；萨姆莎先生看出清洁工想把一切都详细地描述一遍，但他伸出手，明确地阻止她。于是，当她被阻止讲述这一切时，她突然想起自己有多着急，显然很生气，喊了一声“大家再见”，然后猛地转身离开，重重地摔上了门。



“Tonight she gets sacked”, said Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace they had only just gained. They got up and went over to the window where they remained with their arms around each other. Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat there watching for a while. Then he called out: “Come here, then. Let’s forget about all that old stuff, shall we. Come and give me a bit of attention”. The two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished their letters.

“今晚她要被解雇了。”萨姆沙先生说道。但他的妻子和女儿都没有回应他，因为这个女佣似乎破坏了他们刚刚获得的平静。她们起身走到窗边，互相搂着。萨姆沙先生在椅子上转过身看着她们，坐了一会儿。然后他喊道：“过来吧。我们把那些旧事忘掉好吗？来照顾我一下。”两个女人立刻照做了，冲到他身边，亲吻他，拥抱他，然后迅速写完了信。



After that, the three of them left the flat together, which was something they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the open country outside the town. They had the tram, filled with warm sunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on their seats, they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they were not at all bad—until then they had never asked each other about their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held particularly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving house; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a better location and, most of all, more practical. All the time, Grete was becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs.

之后，他们三人一起离开了公寓，这已经是他们好几个月没做过的事了。他们乘着电车去了城外的田野。车厢里洒满了温暖的阳光，只有他们三个人。他们舒服地靠在座位上，讨论着各自的前景，仔细想想，发现他们的工作还不错——之前他们从未互相询问过工作情况，但三人的工作都很好，而且前景特别光明。当然，目前最大的改善很容易通过搬家来实现；他们现在需要的是一套比格里高尔现在选的那套更小、更便宜的公寓，一套位置更好、最重要的是更实用的公寓。格蕾特变得越来越精神。最近他们一直忧心忡忡，脸色也变得苍白，不过，就在他们谈话的时候，格里高尔先生和格里高尔太太……

Samsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.

几乎同时，萨姆沙也想到他们的女儿即将成长为一位身材魁梧、美丽的年轻女士，心里十分震撼。

They became quieter. Just from each other’s glance and almost without knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for her. And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the first to get up and stretch out her young body.

她们安静下来。仅仅通过彼此的眼神，几乎不知不觉地就达成了共识，很快就该为她找到一个好男人了。仿佛是为了印证她们新的梦想和美好的愿望，她们一到达目的地，格蕾特就第一个起身，舒展着她年轻的身躯。

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™



Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.



Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.



The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation



Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.



The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND

DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.



While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.



International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.



Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.



Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.



Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.



Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.



This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
